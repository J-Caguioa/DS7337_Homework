       "['When I was a kid there were only three major things in my life: food, wrestling and `Rocky\\'. My brother and I followed the numerous Rocky Balboa struggles religiously, and even today, there is no exception. Although the latest efforts of Stallone have been pitiful, the movie that made his career is the 1977 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, `Rocky\\'. On top of that, `Rocky\\' also earned two more Academy Awards for Best Film-Editing and Best Director (John G. Avildsen).\\n\\nThis movie is unlike any other ever put on film. It\\'s films like this that remind us of the beauty that is going to the cinema, and if only I was around during that year when such films as `Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\', `Jaws\\', `Saturday Night Fever\\' and `Network\\' were all playing in cinemas. The storyline takes place in Philadelphia, where Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) struggles to make a living as both a small-time boxer, and the brawn of a loan shark. Until one day, a sudden opportunity is handed to Rocky to compete for the World Heavy-Weight Title against the champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), a charismatic and flamboyant fighter labelled as `The King of Sting\\' and `The Master Of Disaster\\'. Attracted to Rocky\\'s reputation as \"The Italian Stallion\", a match between Creed and the unknown boxer is set, which is subsequently advertised as a fight where a \"nobody\" can become a \"somebody\". Mickey (Burgess Meredith), is the owner of the gym where Rocky trains and later becomes Rocky\\'s manager. Mickey is passionate about the world of boxing, and believes that Rocky has the potential to go the distance, instead of being `a cheap second rate loan-shark\\'. However, the central character in Rocky\\'s life is Adrian (Talia Shire), a shy pet-store clerk, who acts awkwardly when Rocky even breathes in her direction. However, these almost completely distant outcasts are strangely drawn to each other. While one `didn\\'t have much of a brain\\', the other `didn\\'t have much of a body\\', so they worked on their opposites, only to end up together. The legend of this film when it was first released in the mid-70\\'s was: `His whole life was a-million-to-one shot\\', but what Stallone did was prove to the world that `Rocky\\' is one-in-a-million.\\n\\nSeeing `Rocky\\' is both a cinematic experience and a religious experience. When first released, the film appealed to the widest audience, and all felt the emotion and intense passion which passed from the film, to them. The film\\'s possession of realistic acting, superb dialogue and the most phenomenal music score by Bill Conti to date, indeed transformed the face of cinema. Stallone\\'s wholesome performance of his own screenplay is electrifying as the film celebrates of the underdog battling to beat the odds. Fans of cinema aren\\'t manipulated into thinking that the inevitable will happen as it does in every other tedious hero drama.\\n\\nOver 25 years on, `Rocky\\' still manages to let the audience\\'s emotions explode; Rocky\\'s blossoming relationship with Adrian, the seedy worlds of Mickey and Adrian\\'s alcoholic brother, Paulie (Burt Young), and the affirmation of Rocky\\'s inability to overcome Creed. And who could forget the excruciatingly compelling Balboa / Creed confrontation? Rocky\\'s determination overturns the boxing fraternity, and supplies cinemaphiles with one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, as a body of spectators both on-screen and off applaud and chant for Rocky in unison. The following four Rocky sequels attempted to deliver the same magic as the original, however failed to convey it\\'s message. `Rocky\\' illustrates how life itself is stifling and perplexing, but sometimes when you lose your way as well as your original intentions, you may just find something better.\\n\\nSimply put, if anyone has a free Friday / Saturday night, this is the film to go out and borrow from the local video store. It\\'s unbelievable that this film was only voted in at #78 on the AFI Top 100 films of all time, and worse yet, was voted in at the SECOND best sports film of all time (the first went to `Hoosiers\\', starring Gene Hackman). C\\'mon people, be you black or white or brown or any other skin colour we have yet to discover, get out there and be inspired by Stallone\\'s masterpiece, `Rocky\\'.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t remember exactly when I first saw this film, but for a long time I thought that the second of the series was my favorite.  Well, I recently bought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knew that it was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best movies ever made.  Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie.  It\\'s a movie about the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to \"go the distance.\"  Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and a debt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell).  He becomes involved with a shy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomes friends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young).  Rocky\\'s life really isn\\'t anything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title.  An old boxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky\\'s manager.  Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some of the greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time.  Rocky striving to go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closing moments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody. Add to this an excellent music score and you have  a classic and unforgettable movie.  Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in 1976.   Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone.  **** out of ****',\n",
       " '\"Your gonna eat lightning and your gonna crap thunder\" \\n\\nRocky is about a poor boxer living his life in Philadalphia. His life changes when an invitation from the heavyweight champ Apollo Creed is given to him.\\n\\nRomance, Drama, Fight.\\n\\nStory- With minimum resources and low money, this movie was an underdog itself. Stallone wrote it and fought to play Rocky. When they were low on resources, they changed the story all together and made it even better. The story is flawless and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 9/10 \\n\\nMusic- The best thing about the movie itself. The music in this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps every time you watch it. Bill Conti gives you an excellent score throughout the movie, including the famous \"gonna fly now\". 10/10 \\n\\nActing- 4 nominated performances in this movie. The acting is very good as well, especially Burgess Meredith who offers one of the greatest acts I have ever seen. Stallone plays Rocky Balboa and changes his voice very well to be Rocky. He did a very good job. Talia Shire plays Adrian, a shy pet store owner who has never had a BF before. She did a good job as well. Burt Young plays the drunkard Paulie. Burgess Merideth plays the boxing trainer Mickey. I have never seen a better performance. 9.5/10 \\n\\nStallone fought for this triumphant movie that made me want to go the distance (sounds corny but its true). It made me strive to work harder and not give up. If you haven\\'t seen this, buy it and watch it. I\\'ll guarantee it will change you too. A classic.\\n\\nI give it a perfect 10/10',\n",
       " 'The first common misconception about Rocky, and something that\\'s almost inevitable when you put a half-naked Stallone with boxing gloves on the cover is that it\\'s a fighting movie.  In that time it would fall into a category including Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jackie Chan.  Now don\\'t get me wrong, I like both of these actors a lot, they\\'re among my favorites, but Rocky is not just another cheap movie about a man who like to win a fight or tournament because he deserves it (Bloodsport, Quest).  Instead of a fighting movie we should say that it is a movie about a fighter.  That changes the context altogether, it means that sure he has fighting on his mind but has other personal issues that are demonstrated throughout the movie.  In fact in the whole movie there are two fight scenes (at the beginning and at the end) which together add up to about 15 minutes.\\n\\n The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart.  That is to say that he keeps his moral and ethics, just keeps on trying no matter the hardships.  A MAN WITH A DREAM... an un-realizable dream to be frank.  But in the end, a lot, even most, of our dreams are un-realizable... but we try anyway.  The difference here is that this man is given a shot at his dream, a \"one-in-a-million shot\". It\\'s something that we all would like so we can relate and CAN\\'T HELP but cheer for him at the end of the movie.\\n\\nThe largest portion, in minutes, of the movie is actually devoted to the love theme between Rocky and Adrien.  So that should maybe make this a \"love story\" movie instead of fighting movie.  Adrien is another of his dreams, slightly more attainable which is why he devotes more of his time everyday to trying to attain it (her).  She won\\'t open up to anybody but in the end, with a certain amount of tenacity on the part of Stallone, she can\\'t help but fall for the heart deep inside the rough exterior.\\n\\nAnother theme here is that of fraternity between Rocky and Mickey, his trainer/manager.  In fact THE MOST TOUCHING SCENE in the whole movie in my opinion is one of about 15 to 20 seconds long and without any words.  It\\'s when Mickey goes to see Rocky at his home the first time to see if he can manage him.  Rocky gets angry with him but keeps it to himself until Mickey leaves, at which point Rocky takes it out on the door jam and yells at Mickey who can still hear him outside.  Rocky\\'s life is being turned upside down by this whole \"fighting Creed\" business and although it is his dream, he doesn\\'t know how to deal with it and is scared to get mangled in the ring, knowing he\\'s not of the same caliber as the champ.  The touching scene is when he realizes that he has yelled at an old man.  His heart takes him out into the street after Mickey, he joins him and shakes his hand.  The beginning of an enduring friendship which will ultimately lead to tears in a later film (Rocky 3 and 5).\\n\\nThis movie simply seeps with \"classic\", and by the end you know you have just seen a movie of courage, of the portrayal of \"the indominable spirit of man\" (Rocky 3).  No matter the difficulties, Rocky\\'s heart takes him through it all.  It doesn\\'t fit the mold of today\\'s classics (like Private Ryan) with melodrama and grandiose scenery, just a simple movie, with simple qualities but very large meaning intricately woven into the fabric of the film itself by Stallone and the director John G. Avildson, with the musical overtones of Bill Conti.  A classic from a different age, and the mold of a lot of movies to follow.',\n",
       " '\"Rocky\" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, \"You have to be a moron to want to box.\"\\n\\nRocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before \"Rocky\" was \"Weekend at Kitty and Stud\\'s,\" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in \"Rocky.\" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it\\'s pretty evident that he had it at one time.\\n\\nStallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.\\n\\nHe lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners\\' thumbs if they don\\'t pay up. He\\'s a muscle man.\\n\\nAfter he returns from his \"job\" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.\\n\\nBut things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. \"An Italian found America,\" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.\\n\\nBut Rocky doesn\\'t realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music \"Gonna Fly Now\" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it\\'s one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It\\'s just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.\\n\\nThe most entertaining thing about \"Rocky\" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, \"Are you sure she knows I\\'m coming?\" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He\\'s not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he\\'s a sweet idiot.\\n\\nAnd the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed\\'s managers says, \"This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!\" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he\\'s got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn\\'t even realize it.\\n\\nThings like that are what make \"Rocky\" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.\\n\\nBut the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, \"Rocky\" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he\\'s got. I think we\\'ve all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with \"Rocky\" all the more.',\n",
       " \"What can you say about a this movie that has not been said already? It is my all time favorite movie series ever and I could watch every movies back to back time and time again. I have owned this movie series on Video, DVD, Blu-ray and owned just about every version going.\\n\\nThe main story is about one mans struggles to overcome the odds life has stacked against him but it is also a love story. There are real touches of greatness such as Burgess Meredith as Mickey as veteran boxer who does not want to train Rocky as he sees him as a washed out bum until he is offered a shot at the big time. Then seeing his relationship with Rocky grow. The acting is superb and the music still pumps my blood to this day. This may have been the movie to invent the training montage which is now a must in any movie about sports or fighting. Stallone's performance is phenomenal as the film celebrates the underdog battling to beat the odds and it is still amazing almost 40 years after release.\",\n",
       " \"As much as the media mocks Stallone, he won best picture for this film. He will never top this film, which made him a icon.  It's a story about a down on his luck loan collector/ boxers who gets a one time shot at the heavy weight championship, because of a late pull out by a contender, and the champ does not want to lose his money on the deal.  There is romance between Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life as Rocky, and together they make life livable. The rest of the cast is other down and outers who give the viewer a feeling of hopelessness until Rocky gets his chance.  This film is touching, and unforgettable.\",\n",

The movie is an absolute masterpiece and can be enjoyed time and time again. I've seen it countless times myself. I hold this film close to my heart. Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay in 2 days, but you would never guess that judging by the depth of the film. It's an emotional roller-coaster that keeps you coming back for more. Rocky Balboa is up there as one of Hollywood's greatest ever creations. \\n\\nIt's a very basic movie, but that's what we all love about it. The best films are usually like that. Very rare a big-budget blockbuster will take home an Oscar. Not only is it a love story, but it's also a boxing tale as we go on an unforgettable journey with The Itallian Stallion. \\n\\nSylvester Stallone is my favorite actor, and for good reason. During the Creed movie he stole the show and should have won as Oscar for his latest portrayal as Balboa. Stallone is not only a great actor, but also a director and writer too. He can do it all. Some say Rambo is his greatest creation, but for my money nothing comes close to Rocky Balboa.\",\n",

       " 'grubby late-night fare achieved way too much success with a primitive story out of 1912.  A silly promotional song, laughable script and performances.  I have no clue why this picture, wearing its heart on its sleeve, ever achieved the critcal appreciation that it did.  This high -concept film is decently enough made, but it helped herald the wave of no -brain feel-good fare of the eighties to the present.  It is also incredibly racist, and seems to suggest that a boxing champ \"should\" be white, even though Apollo Creed does win the bout, the audience is supposed to be aghast.  More ghastly is this idiot in the ring who has his eyelid cut with a razor blade so he can keep on fighting.  I never bothered with the sequels, but Aki Kaurismaki\\'s _Rocky VI_ ought to be even more laugh -provoking than this film.',\n",
       " 'I still remember my initial outrage that this piece of sentimental slop was even made. As unrealistic as they get, this movie included so many cliches, stupidities, and bad acting that it proves for all time just how ignorant Hollywood and the movie-going public really are.',\n",
       " \"I went to see this movie when it came out. I had never heard of Sylvester Stallone and had no expectations or preconceptions other than it was supposed to be a good depiction of boxing. I hated it when I walked out of the theater in 1976, and I hate it even more now. The film is one of sappiest pieces of melodramatic tripe I've ever seen. Every character is a stereotype, and every turn of its derivative, amateurish plot can be anticipated from 50 miles away. Now for the boxing -- a Popeye cartoon has more realistic action. It rivaled the most ludicrous exhibitions staged in professional wrestling matches, and any combatant who endured two minutes of the kind of pummeling depicted in the title fight would be brain dead. My contempt for this trash reached even greater depths when I watched it beat out three outstanding movies -- Network, Taxi Driver, and All the President's Men -- for the best picture Oscar (I've never seen Bound for Glory, but I have no doubt it was also a far better movie than this drivel). I can somewhat understand that a portion of the public would enjoy Rocky, but I can find no excuse for the voting of the Academy members. Shame on them for elevating this sorry excuse for a movie above such worthy contenders. It makes about as much sense as a punch-drunk bar-fighting buffoon landing a title fight with Muhammad Ali.\",\n",
       " \"I was told by many that Rocky is a beautiful movie and I must watched. I did.

I don't even think its called a plot when you can guess the end with your eyes closed. If you enjoy watching grass grow this movie might seem a little fast paced and if you have never heard a story before or lack intellect you might find the plot gripping. \\n\\nI hated it and I want my time back. It was just overrated and I would not suggest this mind numbing movie to anyone, unless I hated them. Maybe thats why my friends told me to watch it, as a practical joke.\",\n",

Story isn't too plausible and is quite dull in spells. \\n\\nThe opening setup was interesting, as it painted a picture of a man in a dead-end situation. But then, just when you think the movie is going to be how he gradually works himself out of that situation, it turns out that it is all about winning a lottery, rather than hard work, essentially.\\n\\nThe only thing that made it watchable after that was the fight scene, right at the end. The Rocky-Adrian relationship is implausible, contrived and clumsy.\\n\\nTo add insult to injury, Sylvester Stallone got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his series of monosyllabic grunts that pass for dialogue. In total Rocky received three Academy awards plus seven other nominations.

Every single person in this movie is brain damaged, from the boxers and trainers down to the ice rink janitor, meat hauling half-wit...\\n\\nThere are a couple of different ways how this shows. The most obvious and most irritating one is the way people communicate. Talking to people is done almost entirely via screaming. Everything turns into a screaming match. It is not only tiresome, but also just plain obnoxious.\\n\\nMany parts of the movie are good, though. The premise is interesting, the setting dramatic just by itself. The boxing parts seem authentic enough, but there's not enough of it here to satisfy those of us who are only here for it.\\n\\nAll other things aside, first hour of the movie is skippable, and the rest pretty forgettable.

       " '\"Rocky II\" is one of those sequels that is just as good as the original, if not better in some aspects.  I can\\'t say it\\'s better than the original because you can\\'t have the second film without the first one.

Sylvester Stallone does a fantastic job with his role of Rocky Balboa and really struts his stuff here.  Talia Shire and Burt Young also pull off nice performances.  Carl Weathers plays the character of Apollo Creed to a \"T\".

       " \"I have to hand it to Sylvester Stallone \\x96 he did the impossible with 'Rocky II' and made a successful follow-up to 'Rocky,' winner of the 1976 Best Picture Academy Award.\\n\\nSome argue that 'Taxi Driver' (also nominated) deserved the Oscar more. I'm not so sure. 'Rocky' came along at just the right time \\x96 it was an uplifting story and people needed that back then. Now, 'Taxi Driver' is usually considered the superior of the two \\x96 but they're entirely different and, in my opinion (and it's a rare one), 'Rocky' is just as good \\x96 but in a different way. They're both great films, and I'm not saying that 'Taxi Driver' shouldn't have won \\x96 but I'm not necessarily saying it should have, either. 'Rocky's' achievement is monumental and it is one of the greatest films ever made. To say it's 'not as good' merely because it is more optimistic is nonsense.\\n\\nSo what's so great about 'Rocky II' and why is it generally underrated? (Its average user score right now on the Internet Movie Database -- with over 8,000 votes -- is a measly 6.2/10, compared to the original's 7.7)\\n\\nBecause it maintains the focus of the first film, and continues the story rather well. A story that didn't really need to be continued, per se, but nevertheless formed the foundation of one of the greatest film franchises of all time. That's right \\x96 many people hate the 'Rocky' sequels, but apart from 'Part V,' they're all surprisingly entertaining \\x96 and, more importantly, well made. I like them; they entertain me, and I think they all serve their purpose.\\n\\nWhat's particularly interesting about 'Rocky II' is that apart from repeating the central theme of fighting Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Stallone) goes through a character arc here that many sequels totally ignore \\x96 we see the after-effects of his fight, and him struggling to adapt to the 'New Life.' \\n\\nRocky is not a smart person. But he is one of cinema's deepest characters. Stallone (who wrote all the scripts and directed three of the sequels) succeeds at evolving Rocky's self-confidence. After winning a small fortune from his famous fight with Creed, he goes out on an impulsive shopping spree, buying a cool car, a new leather jacket (with a tiger \\x96 the beast with the 'eye' that Rocky re-captures in 'Part III' \\x96 printed on the back), and a new luxurious apartment for him and his wife Adrienne (Talia Shire).\\n\\nThe problem is that Rocky soon runs out of money. His happy-go-lucky personality crashes when he is faced with the prospect of losing it all. He promised Adrienne never to fight again, and keeps his word by trying to get a 'real' job at the meat-processing factory (the same one he trained at in the original film). However due to staff cut backs he is fired and soon realizes that he was born for one reason: To fight. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Apollo is eager to take on 'The Italian Stallion' again \\x96 to prove he isn't the coward that criticizers are implying he is. He entices Rocky back into the ring for a final match \\x96 and to say that the outcome is satisfactory is an understatement.\\n\\nMost people seem to forget that Stallone is almost solely responsible for the entire success of 'Rocky' as a whole. He came up with the idea, wrote a script, fought to get it made, fought to become the leading star, and literally fought to get in shape. All of this fighting paid off \\x96 and it continued to pay off as he kept on cranking out all the sequels.\\n\\nIndeed, the 'Rocky' legacy is often poked fun at because it is the typical endless Hollywood moneymaking franchise. But 'Rocky II' and 'III' (more so than the other two sequels) have guts, power, determination and focus \\x96 they've got the so-called 'Eye of the Tiger' and I can't really say that I agree with anyone who says these movies are worthless. They aren't masterpieces but they certainly aren't trash, either. I give 'Rocky II' a hearty recommendation \\x96 it's a truly solid sequel that surprises us right when we expect to be disappointed.\",\n",
       " '\"Rocky\" is truly one of the greatest films ever made. So a sequel to this film would have a tough time following it. Rocky 2 does a great job following up \"Rocky\" and is truly a great film.\\n\\nThe story starts up right where \"Rocky\" left off. Rocky goes to the hospital and has surgery and it is revealed that further fighting could damage his eye badly and make him go blind possibly. So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and starts making commercials. Soon Adrian gets pregnant. However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face.\\n\\nThis film succeeds mainly due to the fact that it does a great job continuing the Rocky saga. It starts right up after \"Rocky\" and further continues the story. It is an awesome follow up. All of the characters are further developed. Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.\\n\\nRocky 2 is really funny, more so than the first one. Love how Rocky goes around trying to get a job despite the fact that he has basically no education. Also humorous is how bad Rocky is at reading cue cards and what he chooses to talk about at his press conference with Apollo. For the most part Rocky and Rocky 2 are more funny than the next films mainly because of how Rocky becomes \"civilized\" in \"Rocky 3\" and loses his sense of humor in some ways.\\n\\nThe training that ROcky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film, slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders. Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.\\n\\nNo film is perfect though. The \"Gonna FLy Now\" song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They use the \"Going the Distance\" song when he is doing his training outside of his running which is fine.\\n\\nAlso the fight at the end of the film is not nearly as good as the fight in the first film. It is mainly just Rocky getting pounded relentlessly and having to overcome a superior athlete. Not like in the first film where it is an even fight for the most part.\\n\\nA great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m old enough to remember the thrill of seeing each of the \"Rocky\" films during their original, theatrical runs. The magical component that Stallone achieved was to tell nearly the exact same story, twice in a row, with the same characters... and yet, he gives us a one-two punch that hits just solidly as the first.\\n\\nIt\\'s truly a remarkable feat. Differences? We\\'ve already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery, the sense of learning who these people are. We already know, don\\'t we? Yet, Stallone\\'s characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them, seeing them in a world most of us don\\'t know, living a life few of us would really want. While the sense of discovery about these characters is gone, our joy of being a voyeur into their world is not.\\n\\nIt\\'s a toss up which movie, \"Rocky\" or \"Rocky II,\" asks us to suspend disbelief more. In \"Rocky,\" we have to accept that a nobody, unrated, club fighter could a) get the chance to fight the world champion. B) He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That\\'s a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies, classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.\\n\\nSoap opera-esquire is not a bad way to characterize \"Rocky II\" because of the emotional ride, but I don\\'t find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky\\'s actions are very believable, from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him (when they were obviously not), to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated, \"punch drunk\" boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey, it happens all the time. Very believable.\\n\\nWith a pregnant wife, no job, and no way to pay his bills, he\\'s backed into a corner. What\\'s a fighter to do? (And in this case, I mean \"a fighter\" in its most literal sense.) He\\'s willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do: provide for his family.\\n\\nAdrian\\'s bit of drama is the single \"problem\" with the movie, but it\\'s also the heart of the movie. It\\'s not a movie about losing it all and coming back again, it\\'s much more than that. It\\'s about a simple man who\\'s trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count, it puts it all in jeopardy.\\n\\nIt\\'s not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is, for what he is, that he can continue his quest, one more fight, for his family, for himself.\\n\\nThe story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side, yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to re-imagine all the magic of the first movie and, better still, give us a second helping of it that\\'s just as sweet. Enjoy!',\n",
       " \"Rocky II continued on from the first movie, and though it was no easy task, Sylvester Stallone did a terrific job returning to his now iconic role as well as taking on both roles as writer and director.\\n\\nRocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has retired from boxing on medical grounds and is getting used to his newfound fame. Unfortunately, his post-boxing career has not flourished which sees him going back to dead end jobs such as working at the meat packing company with his best friend and brother in law Paulie (Burt Young) to keep his head above financial dire straits and his newly wedded wife Adrian (Talia Shire) vows to stay loyal to him. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is enraged by all the hate mail that he is receiving, mostly telling him that his championship match was nothing more than a fluke and vows to do everything in his power to goad Rocky Balboa into a rematch. Though Adrian is upset with Rocky's decision to return to the ring, Rocky teams back up with his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) to regain his passion and pride.\\n\\nThe cast is faultless, and the spirit of the first movie still remains intact. In fact, I found the training scenes to be a lot more uplifting, and I found myself secretly cheering during the penultimate match. And the ending unashamedly had me in tears.\\n\\nI've always had a soft spot for Rocky II and years later, it's one of the few movies that has me going through a roller-coaster of emotions. In some ways, I wish this was the ending of the first Rocky movie. But it is what it is. Still Rocky II is a worthy sequel that goes the distance.\\n\\n8/10.\",\n",
       " 'Sure, Apollo was pointlessly painted as the bad guy early in the film, but this a sequel. While it is not as good as the first film, it still embodies many of the themes and hopes which made the first film so powerful. This time, the audience got what it wanted, a win for a guy who had been kicked down for so long. With more money, the film felt more lucid and better put together, which made it a whole new experience in itself. I especially enjoyed the scene where the kids are chasing Rocky, certainly one of the most complicated and time consuming shots of all time, considering all of the extras the various sequences needed. Better than an average sequel, it still pales a shade below the original film.',\n",
       " 'I reviewed Creed II on March 1 and I ask people how is that garbage movie beter than Rocky II? That movie is not a Rocky movie. Rocky II is a real movie it is one of the best, best, greatest sequels of all time. I love , love Rocky II to death. It is my third favorite Rocky movie of all time! I put this movie above the first one, fifth one and Rocky Balboa. This is the real Rocky, the boxing match in the finale is for real. Sylvester Stallone and Carl Weathers fought for real they did not act. Creed II is a joke!\\n\\n\"Maybe you\\'re right. Maybe I ain\\'t got it no more. All right. Then don\\'t you waste my time no more. You hear that? Go away! Go back to the docks where you belong. You go back to bein\\' a two-bit nothin\\'! But don\\'t you ever come back here again, because I\\'m too old to waste my time... ...tryin\\' to train a no-good loser like you, you bum!\"\\n\\nWhy is this movie so great to me: the dialogues between the cast , the chemistry between Mickey and Rocky. I love Apollo Creed who get\\'s angry when his fans calling him a fake and the fight was fix. He is angry and he chalanges Rocky to a fight. He makes a cartoonish picture of Creed grabbing and choking a Rocky-headed chicken calling him \"Apollo Creed Vs The Italian Chicken\" I love Apollo\\'s traning and he works hard to show everyone that Rocky had a luck. I love Rocky\\'s life he get\\'s married, his wife get\\'s pregnant. He earns a lot of money from his last fight spends his money quickly. He try\\'s to make a commercials but he stinks at it, because he can\\'t read. For six months he was on a docks trying to find a job, but couldn\\'t keep it, so he become a janitor in Mick\\'s gym until he hear a bell the ring becons him one more time.\\n\\nThis is a rematch of the century after his last fight, Rocky has to come to the ring once more again, against Apollo Creed in Superfight 2. Sylvester Stallone wrote a script beautiful directed it and he acted the best ever. This is a classic it is a beautiful movie and I always prefer this movie over the first one, because Rocky wins in this movie. He should won the first fight in the first movie, but he won in this fight. Sly directed beautifuly this second masterpiece. Everyone in this movie does a great job. I love Burgess Meredith as Mickey Goldmill his best performence ever even better than he did the first time. Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed is the best of the best he has more to do than he did in the first movie. I love Apollo Creed in this movie Weathers was the best of the best. Tony Burton Apollo\\'s Trainer was a bad- ass stick him Apollo, him and Apollo were the best opponents to Rocky I have ever seen. I absolutelly love this movie to death! I love Butkus Stallone wearing a shirt and i love how Rocky is walking his beautiful dog. I love Rocky driving a car he was hilarious.\\n\\nI love the brutal fight powerful climax in the finale, I love the beautiful music score from Bill Conti even better than he did in the first movie. I love the traning sequence I just love this beautiful masterpiece to death! Creed II is a garbage! Rocky II is the real Rocky the real underdog movie of all time. I love the opening scene overture it is the best of the Rocky movie of all time. I love Rocky chasing a chicken to get a speed. \"You\\'re gonna eat lightning! You\\'re gonna crap thunder!\", \"You can beat him, because you\\'re a tank. You\\'re a greasy, fast, - Go through him! Run over him!\"\\n\\nEvery time I drink a beer Union I remember this film. When I was 18 in 2002 I was in this bar sitting alone and the wall remind me on Rocky II every time I remember those good times I think of Rocky II! This is my favorite film, I remember this match between Rocky and Apollo I love this movie to death! Yes I put this movie above Rocky Balboa (2006) even tough I love Rocky Balboa to death! Rocky II is my third favorite film, I don\\'t care what anyone says it is the best sequel I have ever saw! I enjoy it, every time I watch it specially the final fight.\\n\\nI recommend this sport\\'s drama to everyone out there to see it. Butkus Stallone had a cameo role the real life dog of Stallone I don\\'t why he didn\\'t had more to do in this movie. I love Sly\\'s dog. All 4 Rocky movies are great with Rocky Balboa (2006). This is my third favorite \"Rocky\" film of all time.',\n",

Apollo after being dethroned by obnoxious Rocky seeks vendetta . While Rocky attempts to prove himself and his family , his wife (Talia Shire), brother-in-law (Burt Young) and his recent born son.

This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness, dignity , feel-good style such as the initial outing. Spectacular and climatic final bout including slow-moving images. Writer-director-actor Stallone new entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling. Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography Bill Butler. The motion picture is lavishly financed by the producers complete saga, Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by Stallone who along with John G Avildsen made the six Rocky.\\n\\nWhile here the opponent is an invincible young boxer,champ of the world, in subsequent entries the contenders were the following : Rocky III against corpulent Mr T from A Team; Rocky IV against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren; and Rock 5 against an ingrate young fighter who he trained played by Tommy Morrison and Rocky Balboa proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight. Rating : Good , being impossible to dislike ,the result is deliciously corny agreeable and predictable amusement . Although we've seen it all before , Sylvester manages to make it work one more time and it works every way even better than subsequents Rockys.\",\n",
       " 'Rocky II is the second installment in the Rocky series. One of my friends told me that I have to see the Rocky movies because they are very good and every movie fan should just see them. I\\'m also just interested in seeing what the hype was about. I actually was very surprised on how much I enjoyed the first Rocky. It had entertainment and was very inspirational.\\n\\nRocky II dove a little more into what Rocky himself is all about. Obviously, from the first Rocky movie, he was just a punk off the streets who just got \"lucky\" according to Apollo, his competitor. In Rocky II, he and Apollo decide they want a rematch to see who is the real winner and fighter of the world since it was a draw match from the first Rocky. Also, Rocky marries Adrien and has a son with her. I did enjoy Rocky II, and I\\'m very much looking forward to the third one. I heard Mr. T is the star! :D \\n\\n9/10',\n",
       " 'Rocky II may be one of the best films ever made. The first was classic and so is this. the first time around rocky just tries to last against Apollo, but now he\\'s going for the win. Without doubt the best fight in the series, with both actors actually hitting each other at some points. My favorite quote of all time is in this film. Afte getting pummelled and floored in the first round, Rocky tells Mickey that Apollo is crazy. Mickey replies classically, No, You cant bet him. Cause your a tank. A greasy fast, 200 hundred pound Tank! Go threw him! Run over em!\" \" The fight is not for the title; it is for who is the better man. One of tho most inspiring films I have ever seen. Whenever you need to keep going, just watch this film.',\n",
       " \"I make a habit of watching movies where the filmmaker is in love with his star. There is a lovely feel to many of these. The camera caresses. The eye lingers. There is often visible emotion in the movement of the eye. This needs to be added to that class. To my mind, there are only three elements: Dumb but lovable and enthusiastic commitment from halfway until the end, after self-doubts. This time we have it accompanied with prayer.\\n\\nThese two elements are not worth watching.\\n\\nAnd then you have the fight, which here you can skip to 1:42 into the thing. It is the whole thing. this is where the camera starts to embrace. The in-ring camera is missing this time; all the shots are from outside the ring, probably six or eight cameras. It fails. This is where Scorsese steps in and does it right, one of the few things I celebrate him for.\\n\\nThe only excuse for this is to substitute the appreciation of ability to take a punch for true valor, or any other admirable trait. Ostensibly Rocky did this for his wife, but we do not believe that for a second. We know who he loves.\\n\\nTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.\",\n",
       " \"Marginally better than the first movie. Not that this says much...\\n\\nRocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.\\n\\nOnly thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene. \\n\\nRocky II is more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.\",\n",
       " \"'Rocky II' is the sequel to the successful 'Rocky' film, and in some ways, it is better. The story of 'Rocky II' was much better, for example. It is not as slow as the first one, and it is more powerful. The acting also improved along with the story, and the showdown between Apollo Creed and Rocky was shot very well. There is also the romantic and personal life moments for Rocky as his wife gives birth and as they struggle to make ends meet. The relationship between the two is strained, and the film captures this element well with the change in events and the focus on life, love, and training. Adrian is Rocky's strength in many ways. A better story than the original, this one should not be missed.\",\n",

He'd rather take the safer route. But after being rejected by the entertainment industry and being victimized by organized labor, he finds he has no choice but to fight the black guy .\\n\\nThe black guy is infuriated by how close the white guy came to beating him the first. It's all he can think about. He can't stand the thought that a white guy might be tougher than him. He's so consumed by it, in fact, that he finds himself compelled to play by the white guys rules.

He decides that even though there are rules to the game they're playing, if he can't beat the white guy in a contest of sheer will, he deserves to lose.\\n\\nWhich he does.

Although neither of them initially wanted a rematch events soon overtake both of them which results in Apollo Creed basically having to challenge Rocky in order to regain the respect of the public. Rocky, on the other hand, finds that life after the match with Apollo doesn\\'t go as planned and he soon becomes faced with mounting debts and a pregnant wife by the name of \"Adrian\" (Talia Shire) to support. That said, rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it pretty much followed the same pattern as the first movie except that it was even more slow and predictable. Now don\\'t get me wrong, it wasn\\'t a bad movie by any means. But I don\\'t believe it was on the same level as its predecessor and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.',\n",
       " 'Rocky III (1982) is definitely tied best Rocky film with IV. It is my third favorite Rocky film. The first one will always be the best. I think the third entry of the franchise is a big improvement over Rocky II in my opinion. He\\'s on top of the world now, bags a statue, and for some reason, Adrian became attractive in this one. Like, REALLY attractive. He got soft, he got arrogant, and he got lazy. He lost his trainer, his title, and most of all, his self-respect to one of the most that makes me angry villains ever to grace the silver screen: Mr. T\\'s Oscar-robbed performance as Clubber Lang and had to regain the \\'eye of the tiger\\' to get it all back in front of the world. This one also proves further that Apollo Creed is human. Guy went from an arrogant prick and sore loser to Rocky\\'s finest ally. Kudos, Carl. I love Mr. T he become famous after this movie there is also Hulk Hogan in it. Adrian in this movie is very supportive and I love Apollo how he was helping Rocky. Rocky III has a heart beside Rocky I.\\n\\nWhy I love this film? This is the only Rocky film in which Adrian is well written - to further support my stance that III fires on all cylinders. Really, what purpose does Adrian serve in II, IV and V? She spends most of those movies telling Rocky not to fight - she is not supportive and just a burden to him. In this one, she actually encourages him and is an asset (speach on the beach.) Heck, there wouldn\\'t be much of Rocky II if not for her objections to. It is the best all around Rocky movie. On a literary level (story), entertainment level, filmmaking level, boxing choreography, characters, etc... The fight at the end actually means something for Rocky. He has something to gain from it (unlike V.) This and Rocky I are the ONLY two Rocky movies where Adrian actually encourages Rocky the whole time (unlike II, IV, and V.) Mr. T is perfectly cast. It was so successful because it was the best. \\n\\nRocky lost everything his manager, his title, his self respect and mostly he lost his edge! Like Apollo said \"Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge! And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning.\" That\\'s what I love. When you lose something don\\'t quit. You need gained back the thing you lost. I love how Apollo motivated Rocky in this film and I think Apollo is well written and portrayed in here. I seriously I think Carl Weathers did a wonderful job portraying arrogant Apollo to an awesome Rocky\\'s friend, to a support and ally. I was surprised Apollo was back in the third entry of the Series franchise. I love the training sequences and the music Score by Bill Conti the same score he used in Rocky I, and II. The same year that Sylvester Stallone made Rocky III the same year he went and started in First Blood, his famous role to this days Rambo! \\n\\nCarl Weathers also said that Rocky III is his favorite film he made. Not only that it is the only Rocky sequel film who won another Oscar award, which is the only one. Beside Carl Weathers I think Mr. T was the best actor portraying a villain in this movie I love how he provoked Rocky I really love that. This is the only film the lasted three rounds. The film has two fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and more fights in which Rocky and Clubber are attending too in the opening scene. Rocky fights a wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in this film. I also love the music score Eye of the Tiger performed by Survivor! \\n\\nI love this film it is my third best favorite rocky film alongside with Rocky IV. The rating I am giving is 9.5/10, I would have give it 10, I didn\\'t because Mickey dies in this film and that was the most shocking disturbing scene to me. \\n\\nThree years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky\\'s trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back. That is the basic main plot. \\n\\nRocky III is a 1982 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the third installment in the Rocky film series, and the second in the franchise to be directed by Stallone.\\n\\n9.5/10 Grade: A',\n",
       " 'This Rocky movie is a rather quick flowing film compared to the first movies and features a bit more comedy while still having drama and inspirational scenes that were pivotal in the first two movies. The fights are different here too, as in this film we do not have the 15 round beat downs of the first films, but rather three rounds of pure hard hitting. In this one we start out with a strange charity match as Rocky the heavyweight champion of boxing goes against the heavyweight champion of wrestling, Thunderlipps (Hulk Hogan in his only decent appearance in a movie, then again it is not really a stretch). This match is rather entertaining and funny, but soon Rocky must face a new challenger to his belt, the very tough Clubber Lang played by a very tough Mr. T. Mickey does not want Rocky to fight this guy as Mickey has seen that Rocky has lost the fire in his eyes that got him the title and would most likely lose to this determined if a bit arrogant new fighter. Well they do end up fighting and Rocky loses and gets hit even worse by the passing of his mentor. Apollo having witnessed the fight and not liking Clubber Lang at all offers to help Rocky train and thus a new friendship is born. The training is nice to watch and I like how Rocky does different strategies against Clubber in the final fight. Sure this movie is a bit more over the top than the previous Rocky movies, it to me is still my favorite.',\n",

The answer is - Obviously longer than common sense allows. The movie was blockbuster, it launched the song \"Eye of the Tiger\" in unbelievable heights, and it achieved crazy success in every way. However crazy it may sound, rearranging of the Rocky story works and it works well.

       " 'Another classic the greatest sequel in the \"Rocky\" trilogy of the 80\\'s. Rocky III come out the same year as \"First Blood\". It is a different third entry in the Rocky saga from the first two movies. It is in an Eye of the Tiger different style. After Sly completed Rocky II in 1979, Sly wrote a script for the third movie so that he completed the Rocky trilogy saga. Sylvester Stallone beautiful wrote a script, acted and directed. This was my third Rocky film of the five films I saw in the 90\\'s. It is my number 2 favorite Rocky film of all time and I love this movie to death! Rocky III in my opinion is better than First Blood and it is my second personal favorite movie of all time.\\n\\n\"Getting out while you can? Don\\'t give this sucker no statue. Give him guts! I told you I wasn\\'t going away. You got your shot, now give me mine.\"\\n\\nThis time Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) will have to face the most dangerous opponent ever, wild Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Rocky is at top of his game, he is still a heavyweight champion, he earns his money with making commercials, he is famous and defends his title 10 times. His life wouldn\\'t get any better until black boxer Clubber Lang comes along and chalenges Rocky to a fight. He accepts the match, but his maneger Mickey (Burgess Meredith) tell\\'s him that his old times are over. Rocky dosen\\'t listen to him goes in a ring and loses his fight in 2 rounds and his maneger dies. But Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) comes out of retirement to help Rocky to beat the new champion once more and rise from the grace.\\n\\nYes this is another best classic sequel in the Rocky franchise that I love to death! I watched this movie on VHS as a kid and I watch it over TV. I am huge fan of Rocky this was an a pair with Rocky IV. This movie has inspirational speach I would say this movie motiveted me more in life than the first movie. After Rocky loses his match against Clubber Lang his title and his maneger Mickey (Burgess Meredith) dies. Rock is dawn, but Apollo gives him hope and he motivated him: \"Look, man. When you beat me, I hurt all over. I didn\\'t wanna know from nobody, not even my kids. Every fighter knows that hurt. We get sick inside trying to live with it, so don\\'t back off now. Make it right for yourself or you\\'ll be sorry you didn\\'t.\" You lost that fight for all the wrong reasons. You lost your edge. I know your manager dying had you all messed up inside. But the truth is you didn\\'t look hungry. Now when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man, the edge. Now you gotta get it back, and the way to do it is to go back to the beginning. Maybe we could win it back together. Eye of the tiger, man.\"\\n\\nThe best of this sccreenplay Sly wrote is \"Make it right for yourself or you\\'ll be sorry you didn\\'t.\" That\\'s right you make mistake you have to fix it or you will be sorry you didn\\'t. That\\'s what this movie is about \"Fall and Rise from the bottom.\"\\n\\nI love the training sequence, beautiful music score from Bill Conti. I love the opening logo of Rocky in opening sequence excellent. The second fight between Rocky and Clubber wasn\\'t realistic boxers don\\'t fight like that. That is why Rocky I and II succeed better. I love Rocky III to death it is my fourth favorite Rocky film. Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed did a great job acting his beloved character. Kudos to Carl when he helps Rocky and trains him to prepare against a fighter Rocky never fought before. I love the chemistry between Mick and Rocky they were a dream team. Burgess Meredith was excellent as Mickey. Mr. T was excellent as Clubber Lang, with all the candidates he got the part. When the movie was premiered Mr T whent watching this movie with his mom. Talia Shire as Adrian is a hot mama in this movie she is not shy anymore and she support Rocky in this movie while in Rocky II she did not support his decision. Hulk Hugan pro wrestler, actor, television personality also appears in this movie. It was his first movie Hogan playes Wrestler Thunderlips. Great choreography from Stallone even the boxing matches. You see Sly fighting more fighters than just one. I love the soundtrack Eye of the Tiger from Survivor the best movie of all time. I love the finale no one knows which hit first was it Rocky or Apollo.\\n\\nI don\\'t have much to say, but I love this movie to death I love it, it is my childhood movie. Rocky III is a great classic 80\\'s best sequel, it is my second personal favorite Rocky movie of all time. I miss Sylvester Stallone and his movies, he use to make in the 80\\'s and 90\\'s.

       " 'As a director (especially one who directs himself), Sylvester Stallone shows no shame. He puts himself in front of the camera more than anybody else, sure--it\\'s what \"Rocky\" fans want--but he\\'s there to be pummeled and humiliated in close-up, to get his audience fighting mad. This way his revenge on the enemy will ultimately be that much more sweet. It\\'s an old hat trick, passed down the Hollywood line, and Stallone doesn\\'t even bother reinventing it, he just plows right ahead as if he were doing something new. Maybe he feels he\\'s demonstrating a new form of manipulation, but it\\'s hard to laugh it off when supporting players Talia Shire and Burt Young are used so pettily and cheaply (one big scene each). Stallone\\'s Rocky Balboa matches jabs with Mr. T. as \"Clubber Lang\", who doesn\\'t so much box as he does pound. This entry in the \"Rocky\" saga goes so far as to make Lang a killer.

       " \"'Rocky III' is the third part in the Rocky story. This is the part where they should have stopped, after this film. (It does have some good moments, but it is not nearly as good as the previous two.) It goes all downhill from here on out. After the death of a dear friend and personal trainer, Rocky and Apollo team up together to train Rocky to get him back competing. This is a story about loss and about trying to get back onto one's feet again after dealing with loss. It's a touching story, but I don't think it is as strong, and I do not think the fighting scenes and the production was as good as the second one. See it if you are a fan.\",\n",
       " \"The third instalment in the Rocky series, the story of Rocky III is set 4 years after the events of the previous chapter and follows Rocky Balboa who, after many successful title defences & his ever increasing fame, is strongly considering retirement but falls into depression after losing the title to a rookie boxer and turns to a former enemy to get himself back in the ring.\\n\\nWritten & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky III is a mediocre sequel that takes the series into a different direction and features a more campy tone that soon becomes very annoying. The screenplay isn't good at all for the plot wastes time on sequences that don't even play any relevant role in the final outcome, not much is added to reprising characters while the new ones are instantly forgettable.\\n\\nThere isn't much to talk about its technical aspects for none of the elements have anything new to offer and while its reduced runtime is a welcome change, the final fight this film was building itself to ends up sooner than expected and on that scale, it's disappointing. As far as performances go, everyone fails to make their mark while Mr. T leaves no stone unturned to make his character one of the lamest ever to step into the ring.\\n\\nOn an overall scale, Rocky III might be fun for those who had a good time with Rocky II but it marks a departure from what the first film was all about. There are a couple of interesting moments in the picture but most of it is forgettable. Stallone's input both in front & behind the camera continues its downfall, the dialogues are pretty much garbage, the finale fails to live up to its hype, and although Bill Conti's score feels repetitive, it's the only element that fares as per expectations. I pity the fool who green-lighted it.\",\n",

Not sure that\\'s Stallone\\'s fault; two has its own issues, but it doesn\\'t look like the throwaway this one does. In all, it\\'s a corny and predictable collection of training montages trying to disguise itself as a movie. And before you say, \"But Matt, that\\'s just what Rocky movies are!\". No, they aren\\'t. 3, 4, and 5 are, but the rest are smart and emotional character studies.',\n",
       " \"Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.\\n\\nOnly thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene.\\n\\nRocky II was more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.\\n\\nRocky III pretty much just follows the same formula. Change the guy Rocky has to fight, rinse and repeat. Only difference here is that we have two fights - one in mid-movie, one at the end.\\n\\nI like the idea of a serialized account of Rocky's life, but this doesn't really add anything original to the series.\",\n",
       " \"Easily the most shallow of the first three. The length of this film does hurt it a bit in that sense, seeing that it's 30 minutes shorter than the first two. A lot of the drama in this one lacks any emotional weight, so I just take this one as some light entertainment for an hour and a half. The main antagonist is very one dimensional, but he is entertaining to watch, even if he is a giant cartoon. Unfortunately, it feels as though this movie just kind of exists when it doesn't need to, but there's still a bit of fun to be had with it. The matches are entertaining, but again, there's hardly any emotional weight behind them, so they are much less thrilling than the final match at the end of the first film. All in all, if you enjoy the other Rocky movies and what to be mildly entertained for a solid hour and a half and not really care about any good drama, then by all means pop this baby in.\",\n",

But, whatever.\\n\\nIf there was going to be a second addition, this should have been it. With Clubber holding the title and Rocky determined to take it. That would have been fine, but, no...Sly wanted riches. I can relate.\\n\\nNow, if you can forgive all that, there is fun to be had. It comes by way of Clubber Lang, the most awesome character of all Rocky\\'s opponents. MR T plays this role very well; his best performance of that era.

He has the latest in technology, nutrition, etc., but you just know the much-smaller disadvantaged hero \"Rocky Balboa\" (Sylvester Stallone) will somehow find a way to chop this \"Goliath\" down.\\n\\nMinute-for-minute, this might be the most entertaining of all the Rocky films, and looks good on DVD despite some graininess in the first five minutes. Rocky\\'s wife \"Adrian\" (Talia Shire) never looked better: mature and pretty; the gruff and profane manager played Burgess Meredith is gone and the repellent obnoxious slob \"Paulie\" (Burt Young) has only a few lines. \\n\\nThis is the ultimate \"David vs. Goliath\" tale in every aspect and the final bout - held in Russia - breaks the all-time Rocky record for most punches ever thrown at two fighters. Of course, any real-life human would have been knocked cold about 50 times had they suffered the blows \"Rocky\" did in this fight! \\n\\nThis is a real flag-waving film with Rocky draping the Stars and Stripes around his shoulders.

He looked even taller than the 6 inch difference between him and Stallone (Lundgren 6\\'4\", Stallone 5\\'10\").\\n\\nI would think that difference in height/reach would make him nigh on impossible to defeat if this were REAL.

He's had many ups & downs in his career & always prevailed. When he fist wrote Rocky he wanted to play the character & the studios laughed & Sly proved them wrong. Then 30 years later he wanted to finish the series with Rocky Balboa & the studios laughed at him again especially at 60! Sly proved them wrong again. We all need a modern day hero & Rocky is one of them. Sly has inspired people in the 70's, 80's, 90's & now the millennium. What other actor has done that? I'm sure he will do the same again with John Rambo!\",\n",

The fact that it was shot during the cold war isn\\'t really a valid excuse for the horribly stereotyped Russians. The entire Russian population seems to consist of people totally devoid of emotion with their sole reason for existence being to humiliate Americans. Even the country itself is stereotyped in that 80\\'s American way where every shot inside the Soviet Union has to be in mid winter. Naturally Mister Balboa and his crew arrive there during a snow storm.\\n\\nThe fight scenes are as badly cliched as the the rest of the movie. I\\'m not too interested in boxing but even I know that punches don\\'t sound like that, and no one gets hit as heavily and over such a long period of time as Dolph and Sly get during their bout and actually live. Of course the fight follows the \"our hero gets badly beaten but then rises to beat the baddie and win over the crowd\" cliche. No excuses for giving away the ending here, someone with the IQ of Rambo could see this one coming.\\n\\nDolph Lundgren is meant to play the robotic Russian fighting machine and as such has to play no emotion except to follow his programmed routine of hate for his enemies. This suits his acting abilities well. He does get one of the best lines in the movie, and virtually his only line when he introduces himself to Rocky in the ring with \"I must break you!\"\\n\\nThe little plot that the movie has is padded out with sequences of bad 80\\'s music that play like music videos. The movie is quite laughable in some places but the constant flag waving does get a bit much so this movie is not even in the \"so bad it\\'s funny\" category.

It\\'s a \"guilty pleasure\" only in the sense that having a dominatrix snap a wet towel at your bare buns in a guilty pleasure.  Rocky goes through his usual homey and decidedly low-tech training routine, schlepping a huge log up a mountainside, carrying it like a yoke across his shoulders.  (Oh, Lord, let us hope this wasn\\'t intended as a religious allusion.)  Dolf Lundgren, who cannot act, is a sullen Aryan monster.  He\\'s given a lousy haircut, in case we might not get the point, and even sports a black mouthpiece in the ring, in case we missed the haircut too.  Stallone almost always has non-Latins in the role of the heavies.  A couple of African-Americans, an Irish gang in Paradise Alley, a Nordic here, an Eskimo there.  I wonder if he knows exactly what he\\'s trying to tap into, what tribal animadversions are oozing out of his cortical sulci.  He practically converts the Soviet Union to capitalism at the end. And all those years we were sending people like Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman around as Goodwill Ambassadors.  Let\\'s see.

I was a huge fan of his first three Rocky movies (which I consider to be great/classic) and \"First Blood\" (the first of the \"Rambo\" movies).\\n\\nIn Rocky IV, Stallone turns the inspiring story of a no-name boxer who becomes world champion into part of the Cold War culture battle between the USA and USSR. Every opportunity is taken to portray Russians in an unflattering light...as drug taking cheats or what not (ironic, seeing as how the US Olympic team is now so heavily tainted by the \"drug cheats\" smear).\\n\\nStallone really embraced President Reagan\\'s Cold War views on Russia. After reading some plot details of the sequel to \"First blood\", I thought I\\'d give that movie a miss. I\\'m still yet to see that movie. Sounds like another Cold War, anti-Russian piece of propaganda. If you are a fan of President Reagan and loved his characterisation of the USSR as an Evil Empire, deserving nuclear annihilation (personally, I didn\\'t find that \\'joke\\' of Reagan\\'s funny, as it smeared an entire people with the muddy term \"evil\"), then I think you will have a lot to like in this film. It will confirm all your views about the US and USSR.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until a couple of years ago, I think, that I finally saw the next installment in this franchise...it was on commercial TV and on very late at night...might have even been the premier of Rocky V! In that film, Stallone, via Rocky Balboa, seems to backtrack from the excesses of Rocky IV. He seems to retract what he was saying in that movie. It was still a very silly movie (no doubt the next worst film in this series), but I\\'m curious now to see the latest in the franchise, \"Rocky Balboa\". Could be fun.\\n\\nReally, this movie is part of the Stallone oeuvre where you could bill his movies as \"Produced by the Pentagon. Directed by the CIA\".

There are simply too many ludicrous elements to ignore: Paulie's robot; Brigitte Nielsen, even less expressive than the robot; about a thousand music-video-styled montages; Lundgren's delivery of Drago's deadly dialogue and much more. The crazed flag-waving would be a lot easier to take if it weren't so clearly a commercial calculation meant to salvage what is otherwise a crass, careless, shamelessly padded film. Ridiculous jingoistic nonsense. Even the hint of political power that Rocky garners by the end of this latest battle is made to seem like more of the same empty glory.

In this episode, writer-director-star Stallone spends ninety minutes (in between blatant product plugs) giving celebrity advice and selfless encouragement to everyone around him, including, in the end, the whole of humanity, wrapping himself in the stars and stripes to plead for universal peace and goodwill after slugging the hell out of his Soviet man-machine adversary.\",\n",

This refers to Movies that are interesting in their own way but fail to live up to the hype or expectation of previous instalments, or simply do not follow the formula that everyone derided for being too predictable anyway. For me, Rocky V is the best of the sequels to the 1976 original, as it does not follow in the Rocky tradition of simply having a bigger guy to fight than in the previous film. Rocky IV was a great spectacle but it was more comical than anything to think that an entire Russian government could be funding one over-sized boxer who could kill a man with one flurry of punches, not to mention turn a blind eye to illegal doping. The fifth instalment in the anthology goes back to the more personal story of the character, and deals much more realistically with the aftermath of loss and the twisted nature of professional prize fighting.\\n\\nStallone recruited his own son for the role of Robert (Rocky's son) and the result is one of the best father son relationships ever committed to celluloid. The scene where Rocky realises that he has been a negligent father and must make his peace with the boy is affectionate and heartfelt and could never been as realistic without the real life history behind these two people.\\n\\nOK, there are some flaws and I am not too naive to suggest this movie is worthy of an Oscar. The casting of Tommy 'The Machine' Gunn could have been better as real life boxer Tommy Morrison sometimes appears wooden and is never really threatening enough to Rocky for the final fight to have any tangible tension. Similarly, aside from the final tune of Elton John's 'The measure of a man' the music does not measure up to the awesome and inspirational anthems that have accompanied previous instalments. Any Flick in the early nineties that used rap music as its primary soundtrack has ultimately dated for a modern audience.\\n\\nMy advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. There are some sad moments in this fall from grace story as well as few goofs in terms of weak acting. But it's not as bad as people say and as the sixth instalment nears completion it's about time everyone got back into the Rocky spirit for one more round.\\n\\nA good film. 7/10\",\n",

Even though it will make next to no difference to the overall rating of the movie, it will at least make me feel a little better. I have watched the rocky series probably 100 times each and if I had anything to do with making them, I would feel offended that Rocky V is rated lower than Rockys III and IV. I feel that, going on best to worst, the order should be The original on top, followed by the second, then the fifth, then the third, with number 4 coming in last. The original Rocky is one of the best movies ever made, no question. By the second film, Stallone took over directing duties and done a decent job with it, apart from one or two corny things thrown in to it. By the third one however, all common sense in the series went out the window right from the opening montage. The fourth Rocky should have been titled Rocky 80's. If anyone over the age of 12 truly loves that movie, you should be ashamed of yourself. The first movie wasn't a sports movie, it was a drama which happened to be about a journeyman boxer getting to live his dream by fighting for a heavyweight championship. Rocky IV is just a big stupid fight scene, with the rest of the movie just filling in time. Why would Rocky turn down his prize money for this fight? Yes, he was doing it to avenge his friends death, but why not avenge Apollo, and make 10 million at the same time which he could at least give to a charity? The training sequence is stupid, why would there be any gyms at all if running up a mountain was better than all the best equipment available, mixed with steroids. The fight scene itself, which was really all they had, was obscenely ridiculous. There isn't a referee in the world that wouldn't have stopped the contest 3 rounds in. Rocky gets dropped a good 10 times that fight but keeps getting up, yet when he drops Drago once, the show is over. He somehow gets an entire nation to change from spitting on him at the start, to loving him, all in under 30 minutes, and all by punching there national hero in the head. And don't get me started on the speech he gives in the middle of the ring at the end, I'm cringing just thinking about it. The reason Rocky 5 is not so popular, is that people were looking for a sequel to Rocky 4, not another sequel to Rocky 1. Number 5 breaks away from the 80's crap brought to us by the previous 2 sequels. It goes back to its roots of a real story, and they brought the original director back for it. This again has made a drama set in the world of boxing, rather than just a 'boxing movie'. And for people who are just after the action, it actually has more boxing scenes than the other movies, its just Tommy Gunn for most of it instead of the title character, who by the way, was played by Tommy Morrison, who went on to win the World Heavyweight title in real life. The script is solid, the characters have depth and it underlines the corruption that is ruining the sport of boxing. If you really are a fan of either film or boxing, rent the movie again and tell me i'm wrong\",\n",

This is certainly the one 'Rocky' story to miss. The story is dull, and it is not as engaging as the others. It is mainly a soap opera between Rocky and his family, and the son is the star of the film; it is a film about him and not so much about Rocky. I would give this one a miss.

This particular \"Rocky\" movie focuses on Rocky\\'s life after boxing. It really develops his character in ways that the other movies have not.

Yeah, you could say that the plot mirrors Sly\\'s life over the last few years, but all the Rocky\\'s have done that in one way or another. This is Rocky back to his sweet and charming self, stunned with what life has thrown at him, and just going through the motions of, well, growing old, but still having that ambition to kick life in the balls and say \"it ain\\'t over til it\\'s over\". He looks great for 60, and doesn\\'t over train for the final bout, he\\'s kept it very realistic, and the fight itself is handled very well, and looks different to the recent wars we have been used to. The film isn\\'t just about boxing, it\\'s a drama, which will inspire you, if you can put your ego to one side and let it.\\n\\nPaulie is fab, he calms things down and stops certain moments turning into what some people may call cheesy. Unfortunately people with no emotions call things cheesy, but they are the ones who have yet to learn what life can throw at you.\\n\\nThis film is up there with I & II, and I need to see it again!!!!!!!!\\n\\nOverall\\n\\nA perfect ending to the saga, and an amazing turn around for the franchise.',\n",

The writing is phenomenal as is the truly inspirational feeling you will get watching this - much like the first Rocky movie. Stallone wore three hats during the filming as screenwriter, director and star. Burt Young makes a terrific return as Paulie. Another highlight is Geraldine Hughes as Marie.

I was impressed with it, in fact the storyline is something we will all appreciate. I am looking all over the internet right now to see if I can find the two speeches Rocky gives in the movie, that gave me chills. One was to the commission, when he tries to get his boxing license, and the other to his son. The acting is great, the storyline as stated before is great, the cast is well put together as well. This is Stallone's best acting ever. The only downfall, I thought was the soundtrack, as Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) entrance music to the fight is great, and of course the theme to Rocky is great, but other than that the soundtrack was not good at all. However as we all know we cannot judge a movie by its soundtrack. This is a must see!\",\n",

While two thru five were good films they had more to do with Rocky as a public figure and his fame. In this film he is not that distanced from the guy he was in the first, maybe just a little wiser. The film doesn't focus so much on boxing as it does on the actual character of Rocky and the trials he faces having one day been on top of the world and now he leads a simple life and thrives on his memories.\\n\\nI am a huge Stallone fan but I realize his career has been in a slump lately, but this film would be a perfect resurrection for him. The acting is great and it has some of the best writing I've seen in years. Two very powerful scenes are when Rocky tries to get his license back and probably the best scene of the film is when he confronts his son.\\n\\nAny Stallone or Rocky fan will love this film. And I'm sure a lot of people who had doubts about this film 30 years later or even Stallone being 60 years old will be very surprised and pleased.

       " 'Rocky Balboa (2006) is truly the best Rocky Movie since Rocky III and IV, maybe the best of all time!! Still the first movie is the best, Rocky Balboa is close to the first film, the best movie in the series of all time! It is my second favorite best film In the series. I love this movie to death the same as I love Rocky I,III and IV to death! in my opinion it is better than new movie Creed! For me Rocky IV will be the best in the series. This movie brings closure to the ultimate sports movie. This movie showed the true essence of who Rocky was and what he was all about. The film has a heart unlike Rocky V who did not had a heart. The most that I love In this film is, the training sequence. The film is fast paced, entraining, not boring or over too long. It truly follows the roots from the first Rocky film, it is a 30.year anniversary after the success of the first Rocky film from the 70\\'s. I love how Rocky meets little Marie (Geraldine Hughes) after 30.years and everything what Rocky predicted in the first film, really happened to her. Tony Duke (Tony Burton) did return in this film. There is no Adrian (Talia Shire) in this film, I am happy she wasn\\'t in here. I heard something that Stallone did not cast her in the film, because she wanted much more money. \\n\\nRocky, helped Marie and her son. He adopted little puppy and he run the stairs of his former statue. Running with his dog on the stairs was one the most touching sequences, I have ever saw! The speech he gives his son is probably one of the most inspiring speeches I\\'ve ever heard. This movie is Stallone\\'s masterpiece, moving, touching, not boring unlike (II & V), Sylvester Stallone gave his best performance after the first film , I ever seen. The fighting sequences are realistic like in the first film! Antonio Tarver (Mason \\'The Line\\' Dixon) wanted more money before he would agree to star in this film, so Sylvester Stallone gave half of his salary so that he did started in this film. \\n\\nRocky Balboa (2006) was a huge impressive improvement over Rocky V. The fifth movie was the most sad film to the series I have ever saw. Even Sylvester Stallone him self was very disappointed with the flick, how it ended. I even heard they originally wanted to kill the Character Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone did not allowed that to happened with his character he invented. I am glad that he did come back after 16.years of disappointment to redeem him self and the most beloved character of the history! I have singly enjoyed this film, more than I did Rocky II, IV and V. \\n\\nPeople keeps saying Rocky V goes back to his roots well that would be Rocky Balboa not Rocky V. Rocky Balboa is going once back they way he was in Rocky I we see Little Marie after 30.years and everything what he predicted really happened to her. Rocky Balboa in this movie he has a heart we also see Spider Rico. Thank god there was no Adrian in this movie she annoyed the hell out of me. Sylvester Stallone made in my opinion one of the best movies and wonderful performance in my opinion. Rocky III, Rocky I and Rocky Balboa are in my top three best movies of Rocky that I absolutely love. After the huge disappointment in Rocky 5, Stallone has come back with a vengeance to complete this historic franchise. And he does it in style. The story is simple, but the characters are beautifully portrayed. I also heard that Stallone was planning to make this film in 2004 after a failure of Rocky V (1990) and he executed perfectly! \\n\\n\"It Ain\\'t Over \\'til It\\'s Over\"\\n\\nThirty years after the ring of the first bell, Rocky Balboa comes out of retirement and dons his gloves for his final fight; against the reigning heavyweight champ Mason \\'The Line\\' Dixon. That is your basic plot. \\n\\nI love this film to death, It is my second favorite best film of the series that I just love and Enjoy. I am giving it a 10/10, because the film deserves it. \\n\\nRocky Balboa (also known as Rocky VI) is the sixth installment in the Rocky franchise, written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone, who reprises his role as the title character. The 2006 film in the Rocky series that began with the Academy Award-winning Rocky thirty years earlier in 1976.',\n",
       " \"I had the opportunity to see a screening of this movie. Having been thoroughly disappointed with Rocky five, I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I am very happy to say this movie brings the Rocky series to the rightful close that the fifth left so empty. This movie isn't so much about the boxing itself, but getting back to the roots of the Rocky story...that determination and courage with the love and help of others makes Rocky a winner no matter what.\\n\\nThis movie is rated PG, and parents will be happy to see that the graphic nature of boxing has been toned down quite a bit in this movie compared to others in the series. If you're looking for a touching family movie with a powerful message, Rocky Balboa is definitely a movie to see. I think adults and children over the age of 10 will throughly enjoy this movie.\",\n",

Powerful acting, an uplifting message, and of course, some classic Rocky boxing fireworks make this film one my favorites of the entire year. GO SEE IT - YOU WILL NOT BE Disappointed! \\n\\n(I saw an advanced screening in Chicago - Sly introduced it - He came off as a real humble, decent guy. He said he wasn't happy how Rocky V turned out. Well, he wasn't the only one. I tell you what though - He definitely made amends with this one because it may be the best, even better than the first. )\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been able to see this before it\\'s release date so I\\'ll avoid giving too much away in this review. To start with when I heard that they were going to make a sixth Rocky movie you didn\\'t have to be a die hard fan to wonder what were they thinking about, particularly 15 years after the last horrible outing! After 30 years since the original ROCKY was released one could only wonder what else they could conjure up after such a long hiatus? Yet this movie was not bad and it\\'s important to stress that on a number of levels. This rendition of Rocky is true to the previous ones as again he is the underdog, a former champ who is encouraged to come out of obscurity and take on the current champ despite having been retired for 20 years.\\n\\nJust to recap to the earlier movies for the moment, in the original ROCKY, in some sort of bizarre publicity stunt Rocky Balboa was plucked up from a short list of \"bum of the month contenders\" to leap frog genuine challengers for a crack at the undisputed heavy weight title. Although he falls short, because of the effort and the show that he puts on, the public demand a rematch and consequently sequel to ROCKY is made and so on. It\\'s important to remember that in the 1970\\'s the American public craved for there to be white heavyweight boxing champion so when the original ROCKY was released not only was it contemporary but captured the imagination of the public at the time. Apollo Creed as the champion was obviously modeled on the brash, cocky Muhammad Ali who you either loved or hated.\\n\\nAlso it\\'s worth noting that in the 1970\\'s and 80\\'s boxing enthusiasts often wondered who would win in a fictional fight between the 1950\\'s champion Rocky Marciano and the 1970\\'s champ Muhammad Ali. Therefore it was no coincidence the name \\'Rocky\\'was used in the 70\\'s, but now today in ROCKY BALBOA we are now asking who would win in 2006, Rocky from the 70\\'s and 80\\'s or Mason Dixon from the 2000\\'s? The question in this movie is actually more like a Rocky Marciano v\\'s Ali now than it was in the 70\\'s!\\n\\nAnother point worth mentioning is that in the original the conceited Apollo Creed was a flashy, arrogant, publicity seeking showman, but more importantly he was human. By the time of Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago in ROCKY\\'S III and IV respectively the Italian Stallion was up against fighters that did not seem to be human. They were void of feelings had no family and their physical prowess and abilities were so advanced that they seemed more like comic book or video game characters. In this movie Mason Dixon to a large extent returns the heavyweight champion to a more believable human role, although contemporary for 2006 i.e. athletic, brash and mean! I give credit to the writers here and to a large extent this is where the movie worked! \\n\\nI don\\'t know if it was a coincidence or if it was part of the thinking but ROCKY BALBOA was fortunate enough to be released at a time when the heavyweight boxing scene itself is in a shambles and resembles a three ring circus. From blown up middleweights to an alphabet soup of nobodies in their late 30\\'s right up to a 7 foot Neanderthal lookalike that is totally useless,--- heavyweight boxing has never been more of a joke! In a time when top athletes in their respective sports are stronger, faster or bigger and more powerful than there peers from earlier decades, heavyweight boxing is about the only sport to have regressed. The skill levels and talent are so much poorer than their counter parts in the 1970\\'s and 80\\'s that none of them could even carry Muhammad Ali or Larry Holmes jock strap\\'s when they were at their best! The International powers that be have in there zeal for money have butchered the world heavy weight boxing scene so badly that its turned into a freak show. Thus the idea of a former champion 25 years past his best challenging for a world title is not as far fetched as it once might have been! \\n\\nThis movie will have it\\'s critics and while it is certainly not flawless I see no reason why this movie should be lambasted as it no doubt will be. At the very least it stands out from being better than 90% of the movies that are released today, many which are simply dreadful. If old 1960\\'s,70\\'s and 80\\'s TV shows are revived on the big screen for the movie industries indulgence or else the public are fed an endless list of remakes why not another Rocky movie! The dialogue and writing while not great was no worse anything else I\\'ve seen recently and the production and camera angles were good. It\\'s slow in certain areas particularly at the beginning but over all a nostalgic effort which tried to capture the theme of the earlier rocky movies. Apparently Sylvester Stallone was never happy about ROCKY V and for years the memory of it tormented him, well I think this one will have exorcised that demon ,a much better effort overall. Check it out!',\n",
       " \"Am I the only one who thought this movie was painful to watch? Major plot holes, huge disappointment. Had I not seen this movie about ten years ago when it was the last rocky picture I would have possibly enjoyed this film. Aside from the initial problems with the premise, a sixty year old man boxing the twenty two year old heavyweight champ, the rest of the film is cheesy, lame and pointless. Am I the only one that remembers him having serious brain damage in the previous Rocky? How the heck can he box now after the damage would certainly be worse as he aged. He would be a virtual vegetable. The relationship he has with his son seems unreasonable and aside from that, his son is not a person I would even care to know. Rocky was the heavyweight champ and now he lives in what looks like a dilapidated shack, yet he has enough money to own an upscale Italian restaurant. Like the previous Rocky, he takes in a surrogate son because he has problems relating to his own son, yet after one conversation with his son the boy is suddenly in his corner and forgotten about living in shadow, he simply resigns to it. Don't waste your time with this one.\",\n",

Instead Rocky came over as a sleazy old man , and the other characters were just pointless and forgettable.The fight scene at the end was boring and to be honest I was hoping Rocky would have a brain hemorrhage and die so no more awful Rocky films could ever be made again!!.

It wholeheartedly captures what was so brilliant about the first film: the characters. Yes, I'll return to theaters to see the fights, but it's the characters, particularly Rocky and Adonis that truly captivated me from start to finish. \\n\\nI can't say enough great things about writer/director Ryan Coogler. The way he masterfully captures the modern spirit of Philadelphia and the visceral tension of standing toe-to-toe with a man who wants to see you hit the ground is second to none.

The subtle nuances that we love about the Italian Stallion are effortlessly worked into the script and flow like water from Sly's crooked mouth. Speaking of, the script would be for naught if it weren't for the beautiful performances by Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. I'm not ashamed to say I was brought to tears at various parts of this film. \\n\\nI'm just so happy to say that this film wasn't a disappointment.

I can't wait to see more from the talent involved in this film, and I proudly endorse and recommend Creed to Rocky fans and film fans alike.\",\n",
       " 'Ryan Coogler\\'s Creed delivers on everything that a great boxing film should, and represents a full return to form for Rocky. Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it\\'s overused plot lines with a different take.\\n\\nFrom the opening scene the film captures your attention, showing us a glimpse into who this character is \"a fighter.\" The film remains an exhilarating journey with this character, who is easy to connect with. As the film progresses, Coogler mixes old techniques like the famous Rocky slow motion sequences, with newer (less used) techniques like very intimate fight sequences, where the camera helps the viewer feel like they\\'re standing in the ring. The film will draw you in from the moment it starts, to the moment it ends.\\n\\nOne reason the film is so exhilarating is the terrific acting of Michael B. Jordan, who leads this journey. Once again teaming up with director Ryan Coogler Jordan anchors the film, and in the process creates a relatable, and human main character. On this note, after seeing \"Creed\" and \"Fruitvale Station\" I would be willing to make the bold statement that I think Ryan Coogler is on his way to becoming the next Scorsese. All of this being said what may be even more satisfying is seeing Sylvester Stallone return to form as Rocky Balboa.\\n\\nSome may criticize the movie for not bringing a lot of original plot lines to the movie, they would be right. However, while not very original the film handles these plot lines from a different perspective. No longer are we watching the nobody rising up against the odds, now we see a man trying to get out of the larger than life shadows of a man he never knew. Those who love the Rocky films recognize the slow motion moments in almost every film, and the iconic way the boxing matches were choreographed. Creed departs from the overuse of slow motion and more adapts the fight choreography of Raging Bull, while still mixing the essence of the Rocky fight scenes. \\n\\nThe way Coogler mixes old with new in many different ways helps make the whole film feel like the story it\\'s telling. Coogler captures the tone of the older Rocky films, while also making a film distinctly different. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver, and Creed ends up being exactly what fans hoped it would be. In the end if you have the time go see Creed, it\\'s a terrific 2 hours to spend.',\n",

The fact that Rocky (1976) won three Academy Awards including Best Picture is of little importance compared to the real life struggle behind the making of that film. For Sylvester Stallone, it was a rags to riches story that mirrored his real life struggles to make a decent and honest living. Cut from the same cloth maybe, but Creed is much more than just the seventh installment in the Rocky film franchise. As a no- holds-barred sports drama, this is every bit an exceptional crowd pleaser with a lot of heart, plenty of amusing jabs to the ribs, and an unexpected but emotional haymaker to the gut. And a lot more.\\n\\nCo-written by director Ryan Coogler, there's no doubt that Creed is a passionate love letter to the first film, which in itself is a poetic love story about fighting the good fight. Although boxing is the central theme, and often frowned upon as a brutal blood-sport that causes serious injuries, it's never been about the fight but more about what you are fighting for. Coogler gets this spot-on when we are introduced to teenager Adonis Johnson in juvenile detention. We soon learn that Adonis is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, born shortly after the latter's death in Rocky IV. Appolo's widow Mary Ann (Phylicia Rashad) rescues young Adonis from what is certain to be a life on the streets and raises him as her own in the plush Creed estate in Los Angeles. Cut to present day and Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) is a corporate executive half way up the ladder. It's a stark contrast to Stallone's blue collar stiff in the first film, but this is where both films converge. Like Rocky, Adonis (calling himself Donnie) knows he is destined for something else, so heads to Philadelphia to meet his late father's rival turned best friend.\\n\\nThe meeting with Rocky is one of several great moments in the film while also serving as a nostalgic homecoming occasion for every fan of the franchise. It's a fascinating intersection of the past but none better than the fact that in many ways, Creed is an inverted mirror image of Rocky. And before sending this film off on its own pulsating trajectory, Coogler reveals a full hand of spades. One of which is the legacy Rocky bestows on Donnie, and in essence, Stallone handing over the franchise baton to Jordan. We may not realize this at first and that's because we are already smitten by the father-son relationship developing between Donnie and Rocky. Their character study is the most significant aspect of this film. Donnie has always been an orphan and the reason why he never took on his father's name is an emotional revelation. Who he is and why he wants to become a professional boxer is his darkest secret.\\n\\nBoth equally emotive and with comic interruptions, Jordan and Stallone deliver impressive performances. Stallone in particular gives what has to be his career best performance since Copland, and if this is his franchise swan song (owing to a devastating but befitting plot device) that's all the more reason why this film must be seen. But as they say, the show must go on and Jordan is more than capable of shouldering future films under the Creed banner. And with the inclusion of Philly local Bianca (Tessa Thompson), Donnie's neighbor and love interest, future sequels look to be set in Rocky's beloved hometown.\\n\\nOnto the production quality and it suffices to say that Creed has THE best technical aspects in the franchise, including spectacular fight choreography, astounding cinematography in the ring and around Philadelphia, and an upbeat hip-hop soundtrack fused with the original score from previous films. The only real letdown comes from Donnie's main opponent (Real life professional boxer Tony Bellew) who isn't as antagonistic as you would expect, given the villainous ferocity from Clubber Lang (Rocky III) and the evil Ivan Drago (Rocky IV). But that's a minor blemish to an overall outstanding film made with grit, substance and style. At its best, Creed is a very intimate film for fans and newcomers and an undisputed knockout for 2015.\",\n",
       " \"Creed is the 7th installment in the Rocky franchise but this time focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps and is trained by Rocky Balboa himself. More than boxing, this movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and Rocky and how they both support each other when they most need it. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Creed. He is so energetic in the boxing scenes and he is even better when his character is being developed. Now we come to Sylvester Stallone as Rocky. In his signature role, he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his best performance in his career as an actor. He honestly deserves an Oscar for this part. He brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions and still has the same charm from the old Rocky movies. \\n\\nCreed perfectly mixes elements from past Rocky movies, especially the first, with modern culture. The amazing Rocky score is complemented by modern styles. Creed's story is told just like Rocky's and it is so beautiful to watch. The cinematography is also visually pleasing. Coogler captured the look of Philadelphia extremely well. The boxing scenes are excellent. There is a fight that is done completely in one take and I have no idea how they did it. It was amazing. This movie is a drama that tugs at your heart a lot, but at times it still manages to be quite funny as well. \\n\\nI love Creed as a film. Its characters are so well realized and acted, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the boxing is glorious. Creed is definitely one of the best films of 2015. Creed gets an A.\",\n",
       " \"Milking the franchise for everything it's got, Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa in the 7th installment in the series. This time, he's smart enough to know he's too old to get into the ring, so he gets some new blood with a familiar name.\\n\\nMicheal B. Jordan plays Adonis(perfect name), a man who was in his mother's womb while his father, the legendary Apollo Creed got his ass handed to him in the 4th Rocky. With the same passion to fight as his father, he seeks out Apollo's old rival and best friend the Italian Stallion to teach him the skills to reclaim his legacy and become a new legend.\\n\\nLike a good boxing movie should, Creed has heart. I'm such of fan of Micheal B. Jordan. He's got the charm and talent to become a movie star and Creed proves he's leading man material.\\n\\nAnd much respect to Sly, who as an aged Rocky, is in the same spot as once franchise regulars, Micky and Paulie. It's humbling for a movie star to take a step back and let Jordan drive the vehicle in front of the camera, and Ryan Coogler sit in the director's chair and pen the flick, but obviously Sly cares about this cow and sought out the very best to make it the very best. Stallone also gave a performance of a lifetime worthy of an Oscar nod for supporting actor. He is Rocky, and watching him on the screen with Jordan was incredible cinema.\\n\\nAnd the action in this movie was amazing. Some of the greatest battles in cinematic boxing are happening in Creed. We are so close to the action you can feel every hit. Also have to comment on Jordan's boxing skills. Creed, does an excellent job with showing a boxer going from having raw talent, to becoming a champion.\\n\\nDefinitely a worth wild boxing movie to see, and I think the best Rocky film since number two.\",\n",
       " \"Although young Michael B. Jordan has the title role in Creed the film really belongs to Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of players like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar nominations for playing the same role. In the case of Sly and Newman both aged naturally into the parts of Rocky Balboa and Eddie Felson. It's hard to believe that it has been 39 years since Stallone debuted Rocky Balboa. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone got for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed.\\n\\nBut between that there have been several Rocky films over the years as Sly has developed more facets to the fighting Mr. Balboa of Philadelphia than I'm sure he even thought of when he debuted Rocky. It all really comes together with Creed.\\n\\nBut as for the story it seems that back when Apollo Creed was killed in that fight with that Russian steroid machine Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV he had a dalliance that resulted in a post mortem birth of an illegitimate son who grew up to be Michael B. Jordan, character name of Adonis Johnson. Apollo's widow Phyllis Rashad took him out of foster care as his natural mother had died and raised him.\\n\\nJordan has an interesting dichotomy to deal with. He's his father's son and wants to make it in the fight game, but on his own as Adonis Johnson. He seeks his father's old friend and rival Rocky Balboa as a mentor and Rocky trains him for a title shot at the light heavyweight championship. \\n\\nRocky Balboa is not the most articulate movie hero ever developed, but he sure imparts a lot of wisdom to Jordan. Those scenes with Jordan are what got Sly Stallone that second Oscar nomination. Also Rocky has some personal crises of his own to deal with. These guys are of incalculable help to each other.\\n\\nI really loved this film and how Stallone developed Rocky to this point. Like fine wine, Rocky gets better with age.\",\n",
       " \"First off let me say that I have been a life long Rocky fan. With that being said I went into this film very cautious as almost the entire cast and crew were brand new. The trailers looked good, but today a good trailer is not necessarily an indicator of a good film. Sylvester Stallone killed it as a much older and more breakable Rocky. Michael B. Jordan's performance was as good if not better than Sly's. I think that from this day forward anytime I see Jordan, I will think of him as Creed and not whatever character he is playing. The story was engrossing and well thought out. The film pays a great amount of respect to the Rocky films while at the same time carving out it's own place in boxing film history. Honestly I have no idea how accessible this film would be to someone who's never seen a Rocky film, but I think the way the story flows it wouldn't be too much of an issue. Again, highly recommended.\",\n",
       " 'As a boxing movie Creed packs a heavyweight punch.\\n\\nSylvester Stallone (as the film\\'s producer) has covered a lot of miles with his Rocky legend, most recently with his 2006 Rocky Balboa. As such I had thought there was little milk left in the cash cow, but \"Creed\" proves me wrong. This time, with Stallone\\'s advancing years, he wisely doesn\\'t stretch credibility by having Rocky Balboa as the center of the pugilism, but hands the baton to young contender Adonis (\"Donnie\") Creed (Michael B Jordan). Adonis is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Rocky\\'s protagonist and later close friend in the first four Rocky films.\\n\\nDonnie is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks with a big chip on his shoulder and a reputation for finding trouble with his fists. Brought back from the brink by Apollo\\'s wife (a touching performance by Phylicia Rashad) Donnie can\\'t escape his family legacy and seeks Balboa\\'s help to make it in the ring, using his own adopted name. Balboa\\'s help leads to a number of \\'traditionally\\' brutal Rocky-style encounters in the ring. \\n\\nI must admit I don\\'t normally \\'go\\' for boxing films like this, but this is extremely well done. All of the boxing training is gritty and believable and the actual bouts, particularly the classic finale, is suitably thrilling and a technical masterpiece of camera-work (hats off to cinematographer Maryse Alberti, who also filmed \"The Wrestler\" so is no stranger to the ring). \\n\\nA real surprise is just how good Stallone is in the role. There are scenes where Stallone really has to act – particularly an emotional locker-room scene when Rocky faces up to his own personal crisis – and any jokes about Sylvester \"Expendables\" Stallone\\'s acting abilities are forgotten. Michael B Jordan is also a great find and a name to watch. He has to cover a wide range during the film and succeeds admirably.\\n\\nTessa Thompson, impressive in last year\\'s \"Selma\", makes a similarly positive impression here playing the love interest in the form of songstress Bianca, with a difficult future ahead of her.\\n\\n\"Creed\" is a love letter to the old Rocky films, and – with this quality, and likely success – the start of a whole new generation of films seems probable. The respect it shows to the originals is characterized by a moving tribute to the classic \\'Philadelphia steps\\' scene that brings a genuine lump to the throat. That being said, the film is a lot more \\'street\\' for a new generation, with a soundtrack (by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson) that mixes rap and hip-hop with more classic orchestral elements. Without outright plagiarism of Bill Conti\\'s classic score, Göransson subtly weaves in some of Conti\\'s themes, notably Adrian\\'s theme, as well as coming up with his own \"Fly Now\"- equivalent musical high-point.\\n\\nImpressive direction is by Ryan Cooglar in only his second feature film (after Fruitvale Station, also with Michael B Jordan). Cooglar also wrote the story and co-wrote the script. Without any spoilers, the story is delightfully \\'un-Hollywood\" by being unpredictable in where it goes. However, an area for criticism is that it took a few \\'easy\\' short-cuts in places: a particular \\'change of heart\\' in the film is way to glib and quick.\\n\\nFinally, i would love to watch this film in a cinema in Liverpool, when the \"hallowed turf\" for a bout is revealed as being Everton\\'s ground, Goodison Park\\x85.! Generations of Liverpool FC fans will be turning in their graves and I predict that cinemas in the city could become scenes of the worst hand to hand combat since the finale of Kingsman! \\n\\n(Please see the graphical version of this review at bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks.)',\n",
       " 'Just like it\\'s counterpart, even this 7th installment to the franchise has proved the fact that the true story of the universe has just begun. Creed just like the original movie of the series has a strict focus on the characters, their struggles and eventual triumph, with only a role switch with the son of \"The Apollo Creed \" . This is one of the only few movies I loved watching this year, and I am pretty much thankful I did. In this review I shall justify the reason as to why this movie has received a rating as high as a 9/10.\\n\\n1)Story :- The basic story is backed by a pretty good script and an engaging narrative that puts Adonis Johnson / Creed , son of Apollo creed in the centre of the fight this time. But unlike his father\\'s story , this man is forced to battle his unfulfilled passion for fighting , unjustified emotions that cross him and a blockade that brands him as a man born from someone else\\'s legacy. The story technically puts Adonis on the radar, while the people around believe him to be a man whose fame comes by his father\\'s legacy. This is a story of how a man, with a will to create a mark in history for himself, steps into the ring, not only fighting the fight , but battling his priorities. The story sometimes is vague reminder of the first rocky, but the distinctive performances from both actors see to it that this movie rises beyond those insignificant questions. \\n\\n2)Casting And Characters:- The casting and characterization of this cast is what makes this movie splendid. Though the script is more or less that of a generic boxing movie seen a million times before , it is the distinctive performances by the lead Michael B Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. This is one of those movies that solely concentrates it\\'s screen time on only those characters that require screen space to ideologically progress the story. While the movie consists of other members like Bianca the love interest and Mary Creed , Adonis\\'s mother , all these plot devices are only meant to build the tension during the final fight and are completely disposable , since they add little to nothing to the actual plot to be significant . But what is evident is that director Ryan Coogler, has done is absolute best to pull the best out of every cast member who was a part of this movie. But when all is done and said, I cannot be absolutely fair while I express my love for the man who started it all , and the man who almost overshadowed Creed\\'s performance in this movie , The Rocky Balboa a.k.a Sylvester Stallone. This man has proved the fact with this movie that he is not just the broody, rough and tough man who does action movies but is an actor who has the potential to ACT. That\\'s right, Sylvester Stallone after a million fails has proved that he is no more expendable. His performance swelled my eyes with tears and without spoiling anything, Ryan Coogler\\'s decision to modify the characters life in the way he did so , was not just best for the plot , but best for the ultimately produced definitive performances too.\\n\\n3)Direction :- When directing a movie for a franchise that has spanned for many generations it is a risky move for us audience when we witness a new chapter. The movie could either be a project made as a nostalgic cash grab or a passion project that respects it\\'s previous entries but becomes different and distinct at the same time. And just like the Creed in the movie, Ryan Coogler has proved that this movie is not just made as a product of Rocky\\'s legacy but a project that has the ability to stand on one\\'s own foot to essentially act as a reinvigoration of what Rocky was originally imagined to be. Coogler has managed to build a completely new atmosphere for this franchise that gives a sense of difference and change but at the same time , affixes us to the city of Philadelphia that we have known and loved since the original Rocky with the perfectly cued original soundtracks that assures us that we are actually connected to the world we always loved. It is evident that the style of direction that Coogler used for this movie is something completely different from the previous Rocky movies. This one goes in the line of other dark boxing movies such as Warrior where colours of the world around are dumbed down to create this dark and gloomy environment and everything in the frame of perspective is saturated with detail to create an exact and realistic picture of the sport of boxing in the best way possible . What I was let down by , slightly , was Coogler\\'s quick jump takes and cut-shots during the final fight , that actually put me out of the intensity that the shot had to have. Overall, Coogler\\'s direction is brilliant in many ways and it was his vision that was desperately needed to create , progress and continue the now 6 movie franchise. If you have already watched the movie, the final scene of Rocky climbing the stairs followed by a focus shot of the city from the height explains exactly why I praise his direction so much.\\n\\nOn a whole it was an absolutely unexpected journey filled with the excitement, vigor and energy that every Rocky movie had. If you are a person who would step in a theatre or watch this movie just for the fights, let me warn you right away and tell you that you will be disappointed. This movie is a directorial and character driven drama whose ultimate underline of boxing gives the much needed progressive element for the plot. And is definitely one of the best movies of 2015.',\n",
       " 'I can say with all seriousness that Sylvester Stallone deserves his Oscar, and I didn\\'t believe that the original and rather obvious \"Rocky\" deserved Best Picture Oscar, so I\\'m not some fan blind to the weaknesses of the series . He was excellent in that film. While some can argue that the Oscar would be a reward for the entirety of the Rocky franchise, I think that Stallone\\'s performance in Creed stands on its own and is wholly deserving of any accolades he receives. His performance of an aging Rocky Balboa coming to terms with his own mortality (and the mortality of his loved ones, like Pauly and Adrian) and dealing with the effects of aging and the realization that he cannot partake in the rigorous boxing world anymore is very heartbreaking and compelling. Without providing any spoilers, the scene in which Adonis Creed and Rocky return to the famous steps from the first Rocky is a very poignant scene.',\n",
       " 'This is the worst movie about boxing! Ever! So predictable and boring. I almost slept during the movie projection at the cinema. Son of Apollo Creed, Adonis (what a name!), is self-taught fighter, fights occasionally in Mexico with some losers and win those fights. Soon after that he knocks-down a 6th fighter in the world in the gym! Fighter no.6 knocked-down by unexperienced fighter who was never trained by trainer. Un-be-li-ev-ab-le! What a cliche! What came out of Hollywood movies? Who gave to this disaster so high ranking? Nominations?! Awards?! Nothing than a shameless fraud!',\n",
       " \"Movie sucked!!! Makes me appreciate old school fight movies instead of this crap! Michael b.Jordan acting was mediocre at best. Sylvester Stallone could of gone a better angle bringing his son to follow the legacy,script was poor, and the scenes were poor, Story line was beyond cheesy, and predictable To me this movie tarnished the rocky legacy along with rocky 6, Stallone retired already, or at least try something different perhaps love story, I'm kidding, last few movies with Stallone have been a let down, Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this movie, director seemed very amateur Pop corn and movie rates this 5/10 People need to know how to give better reviews because the 8 they gave this movie is ridiculous.\",\n",
       " 'This is just the thing that is rotten with the so called \"American way of Life\". You could forgive the very first Rocky-film, because, although it was about competition, it was also about a Young man with abysmal prospects in Life grabbing the one chance he had for a better Life. That film did not necessarily glorify competition. You could even say that it was critical of a society, who gives a man no other option to better himself than to send Another man to kingdom come.\\n\\nAfter so many Rocky-films now past, there is now so such excuse. It\\'s all about knocking out the other guy even if the score in the end may read differently.\\n\\nJesus Words \"Love each other\" has nothing to do with the American society, which I prefer to call \"the swingy\", since it produces swines and not human beings.',\n",
       " \"Not really worth the time.Not even comparable to the worst of the rocky franchise.I really hopes for something better.Of course,not something as good as the last Rocky film but at least a decent one. Got really bored from the start and that didn't change at all.Unoriginal plot. Not even a big fan of the Rocky franchise,as myself,would appreciate this movie.It might make you angry though,that Stallone chose to film this.The plot is weak and the protagonist not that good at his role.The training scenes are bad,not even close to comparison to the older movies.The fight scene was even worse,really boring!!Even the soundtrack was as bad as the rest of the film. At least i didn't pay to see it,that would be an even bigger waste!!\",\n",
       " 'Before I begin I must say that Rocky is my favourite movie of all time. What made Rocky so gripping is the fact that the protagonist was a classic underdog striving to reach his potential and stand up to his critics and those who set out to humiliate him. It\\'s a film about determination, passion and persistence and we get to follow him on this tough journey.\\n\\nCreed, on the other hand, is a story of a generic black lad who takes up boxing on a whim because his dad was a boxer. Unlike his father who radiates charisma, Adonis Creed has a distinct lack of a personality and just fits into the stereotype for two dimensional black male protagonists. In fact, I would say he\\'s the most two dimensional character since Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace.\\n\\nOf course, the Hollywood template requires a love subplot, so throw in generic black girl. We also have Rocky making a token return. To his credit, Stallone has a couple of emotional scenes and plays them very well, but the subplot seemed somewhat rushed and undeveloped...like the rest of this movie.\\n\\nI just couldn\\'t get behind Creed. I didn\\'t feel his motive for boxing; I didn\\'t feel any emotion behind his performance or see any real heart or passion. It\\'s like he gets his opportunities handed to him and just comes across as an advantaged kid.\\n\\nFor me, the most interesting character in this movie was the champion, Ricky Conlan. He is cocky, brash and intimidating and Tony Bellew plays the role in a convincing way. In fact, he\\'s very reminiscent of Apollo Creed in the first two Rocky films and his characteristics would\\'ve made for a much more interesting Adonis Creed in my opinion, as an anti-hero protagonist. \\n\\nUnfortunately \"Pretty Ricky\" gets limited screen time and doesn\\'t get the build up he deserves. As a result, there is no rivalry between the two boxers and no real sense of adversity. I soon found myself backing Conlan and hoping for him to teach Creed some humility. \\n\\nMaybe I am being harsh on this movie because I\\'m comparing it to Rocky, but this is clearly a rehash of the original classic, so a comparison is inevitable. And on the whole it falls drastically short, lacking all the main traits that made the original movie so successful.',\n",
       " 'The best moments of \\'Rocky/Creed\\' movies are the ones that make you feel something. Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you\\'d like but a few. Adonis \"Donny\" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don\\'t pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first \\'Creed\\' or \\'Rocky.\\' There\\'s something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series. Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer\\'s room and one that should not have been the final choice. It\\'s tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we\\'ve seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies. On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out. Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago\\'s dad killed Donny\\'s dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don\\'t see the struggle. Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason. In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It\\'s satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you\\'re dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.',\n",
       " \"All movie I kept looking at my watch because I didn't want it to end. It was 130 minutes that felt more like 45.\\n\\nThe fights (and there were more than normal) were great, but the movie was much more than about the fights. It was about family, loss, motivation, legacy, and the part that really touched me was the focus on fathers and sons.\\n\\nDolph Lungdren and The Big Nasty were perfect villains, but unlike most movies you see the loss that the villains endured and what shapes them. I couldn't help but feel for them a little too - particularly the son.\\n\\nSly was obviously great as Rocky, and he was more down to earth and relatable than ever. Smart how they keep fading him more and more into the supporting role as Caple, like Coogler do a great job of remembering he is not the focus. I loved that Little Duke got more of a roll, and I think that he's someone who would be able to carry the franchise as mentor/coach if Sly ever decides to give this up. Phylicia Rashad was charming as MaryAnn, and you could feel her emotions going through this again with the family who took her husband's life. MBJ and Tessa Thompson were absolutely brilliant, and their chemistry is just so natural. Bianca walking out with them and singing leading Donnie to the ring for the final fight - CHILLS!!!\\n\\nThe ending fight sequence, and what happens after and how they have separate endings at the same time for Donny and Rocky made it the best ending of any of these films.\\n\\nAs a lifelong Rocky fan (my Dog's name is Clubber), I think I actually like the Creed franchise more. I like the cultural difference with Creed, and it just seems more grounded and for lack of a better word quality writing and directing. If they make 10 more I'd go and see all of them!\",\n",
       " 'Formulaic and the same story told again. But updated enough to feel new and still a fabulous formula. Loved this movie and Michael B Jordan is the real deal star. It was great to see Stallone and Lundgren on the same screen again. They did a great job humanizing the Russian character instead of making them the enemy.',\n",
       " \"I took my son to see this on Thanksgiving night and we both loved it! Creed II is a very well written sequel and adds quite a bit of emotional pull. I really like how the boxing scenes were filmed, you almost felt like you were in the ring feeling the hits. The family aspect of the movie felt absolutely natural and fit perfectly with the film's flow. The father/son relationships were brilliant. You even felt for the antagonistic Ivan/son and their story, while at the same time building a dislike for them, which is a difficult task from a writing standpoint. I saw another review that stated they wanted to walk into the next showing as soon as the movie was over and I would definitely have to repeat that sentiment! Creed II lived up to the hype over the last 3 years I had self created for it. Go see it!!!!!\",\n",
       " 'You have to give Sylvester Stallone credit--he has a gift for remixing the same movie over and over and again and making you actually care. Maybe it\\'s because he focuses on the one thing that matters most in storytelling: compelling characters. And Creed II is full of them.\\n\\nFirst, there\\'s Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), the brooding, bratty, world champion with a chip on his shoulder. There\\'s Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), the downtrodden wise sage who only recognizes his role in things when the chips are down. There\\'s Bianca Taylor, a talented singer suffering from hearing loss and her love for a self-destructive boxer. There\\'s Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), the weary widow of Apollo Creed who is consistently forced to check her man-child son, and then there are the villains. Ivan and Victor Drago (Dolph Lundgren and Florian Munteanu), the Russian outcasts seeking redemption for the failures of Ivan Drago. Everyone has a purpose in this film, and everyone has a place in moving the narrative forward: avenging the actions of Rocky IV.\\n\\nThis is a straight-up reboot of a Cold War classic, complete with the final match taking place in Russia. You know what to expect. The challenge from Ivan\\'s son is the kind of storybook rematch the sports world loves. You know Creed has to take the fight to prove himself. And you know at some point, Victor Drago will get the better of him, setting us up for a training montage that never seems to get old. You see, when Rocky IV was released, it wasn\\'t just a boxing film, it was practically a propaganda film about the superiority of American values and ideals. In Creed II, it\\'s not about the country--it\\'s personal. It\\'s about discovering what matters most to you in your career and your own life. And as cliched as that may all sound, it works amazingly well in this film, thanks in part to the strength of the movies character development, phenomenal actors who keep the theatrical bits grounded and brilliant fight choreography and cinematography to settle scores.\\n\\nI\\'ll be straight with you, we shouldn\\'t like Adonis Creed, but we do. He\\'s a temperamental grown man baby that even knocks himself in the movie for \"acting like a b---h.\" We shouldn\\'t care about Victor Drago--he\\'s a carbon copy of his android like father Ivan and barely has enough dialogue earn a film credit. But we do because we know that his father is living through him. The once powerful Ivan is an outcast in his homeland, and Victor\\'s mother walked out on both of them because she has no respect for losers, so they\\'re surprisingly sympathetic characters in their quest to be menacing. And we shouldn\\'t care about Rocky\\'s meandering ruminations about putting family over boxing when at no point in his career, did he ever do the same. Yet somehow this movie manages to make you care because the film understands that it\\'s real power are in those small reflective moments building up to the fight. Moments like Creed\\'s return to the local cheesesteak house and being welcomed by the fans who urge him to take the battle against Drago. Moments like Bianca and Adonis laying on the floor together like they did in the first film pondering their relationship and what Adonis\\'s decision means for them. It\\'s moments like Rocky pondering the broken relationship he has with his own son and trying to figure out if he dares to make amends. This is the glue that holds these films together--putting family above career and ego. And when it finally comes time to fight, your emotions are so heavily invested in the outcome that you\\'ll find yourself (as did my audience) verbally cheering on Adonis Creed.\\n\\nAnd in the end, it\\'s the smallest of gestures by Sylvester Stallone (which I won\\'t spoil) that lets you know that Rocky Balboa has nothing left to give and it is now Adonis Creed\\'s time to shine in whatever sequel they have planned for us. Creed II a great time at the movies, even if it\\'s a predictable one.',\n",
       " 'The way the fight scenes are orchestrated makes you really feel like you are in the fights. With the display of power and transition of powers you really feel into it. When something would happen the entire crowd would cheer as if they were really there and everyone jumped out of there seats and clapped. Very rarely do you see a movie do that to people. Creed 2 is something special.',\n",
       " 'This film is great. It\\'s so very deeply moving. Tears streamed my face during certain deeply meaningful scenes in this film.\\n\\nThe film isn\\'t really about boxing nearly as much as it is about the love of family. Like the 1961 film \"The Hustler\", it\\'s not really about winning and losing, either. It\\'s about familial love, especially the love of fathers and sons, estrangement, loss, forgiveness, redemption, and reconciliation.\\n\\nThe film is about true family values and how very much more important they are than anything else in this life. Although the boxing scenes are great, they are only incidental to the overarching theme of family in this film. My most heartfelt kudos and thanks to the filmmakers of this great story.',\n",
       " 'Of all the \"rocky\" movies that have ever been released, this by far stands alone as the best in my opinion. The backstory to the main fight never leaves you bored and manipulates the audiences emotions so well. The chemistry between Jordan and Thompson is truly amazing and Stallone continues to evolve the Rocky we all thought we knew. The fight at the end of the movie was so gripping that the audience cheered out loud with every punch, blow, and knock down. This movie was not only good, it was great. GO SEE IT!!!!!',\n",
       " 'I wonder why this movies got such high ratings. There is nothing new in movie, just the old repetitive story , rocky comes to rescue. I think they should stop making movies on rocky anymore .Being a ordinary guy I can write better script than this story. What a waste of time and money',\n",
       " 'Autistic acting, banal script, predictable plot, disappointing action, retard humour & a complete yawnfest... Whoever thinks Michael is a good actor should just keep their opinions to themselves...',\n",
       " \"Worst Rocky movie I ever saw. The Apollo Creed story doesn't do it for me.\",\n",
       " \"Maybe i watched a different movie, because i cannot believe how good or even raving reviews this one is getting. I have found Creed II disappointing, with a simplistic and predictable script, full of cliches. At least the boxing and training parts should be good, but they weren't either. The boxing in this film seems more like street fighting, with boxers landing more clean punches within the first minute of the fight than Mayweather jr or even Tyson in his heyday could in entire 12 rounds. Completely unrealistic. And training for such an important fight in a desert? Please. The film doesnt say anything honest about the boxing business, we see here a successful US boxer living like a recluse, in a mediocre apartament, surrounded only by his one loyal aide and his wife, what about the usual entourage and swarm of people like masseurs, coaches, media assistants and publicists, financial advisers and groupies? What about the money and the financial motivations? Every top boxing fight is basically about earning millions of USD, in the real world. It is a simple film for the naive audience. OK if it was at least entertaining, but nope.\",\n",
       " 'Do not waste time. This movie sucks; I will just keep the good old memories of the first four movies.',\n",
       " \"Writing unoriginal and predictable sequels has been done before, by Sylvester Stallone, in the Rocky Series. I actually liked the Rocky movies upto 4, with all the ones after being pretty hopeless. The character of Adonis Creed is totally unlikeable, unrelatable and has the emotional intelligence of a 2 year old toddler. The film is a complete rehash of virtually every Rocky movie and it has no value added for anyone who has seen any of the previous films. It's so bad, I'm writing this review as the film is playing out the last 30 minutes, I don't care what happens to any of the characters. You feel no emotional attachment at any level, with any of the main protagonists. How anyone can score this film 10/10 and say it packs a punch, delivers a knockout or other boxing pub, is beyond me. I am usually patient with find and I can usually pick our something worthwhile. Even the boxing scenes, a high quality feature of the Rocky movies, is sadly lacking in this movie. Terrible choreography and fight scenes, just put the cherry on top or what is arguably one of the worst boxing movies to hit the screens in a long time. Please please please Slyvester, stop making these terrible movies!!\"]"

I collected ten positive and ten negative reviews (generally classified as at above or below a 5/10 rating, respectively) for each title; a total of 160 links are in the list in Q1. However, my BeautifulSoup code that relied on review text being present in a JSON object in the head of individual pages unexpectedly fell apart on reviews where the text is initially hidden by a spoiler warning. Rather than spend more time replacing those, I set my collector of review texts to simply ignore pages where it could not find the JSON tag I initially wrote for. Thankfully, I was still left with 116 valid reviews.\n",
